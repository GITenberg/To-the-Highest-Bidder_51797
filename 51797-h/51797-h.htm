<h2 class="p4">THE HIGHEST BIDDER</h2>

<h2 class="p2">I</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">Abram Hewett</span> and his son “Al” were distributing
the mail in the narrow space behind the high tier of
numbered glass boxes which occupied the left-hand
corner of the general store known as “Hewett’s grocery.”
There were not many letters and papers in
the old leathern bag whose marred outer surface bore
evidence to its many hurried departures and ignominious
arrivals. Only the “locals” stopped at Barford;
the expresses whizzed disdainfully past, discharging
the mailbag on the platform of the ugly
little station like a well-aimed bullet.</p>

<p>There was one letter in the scant pile awaiting
official scrutiny over which the younger Hewett
pursed his thick lips in a thoughtful whistle. He
turned over the thin envelope, held it up to the light,
squinted curiously at it out of one gray-green eye
before he finally deposited it among the letters destined
for general delivery.</p>

<p>This done, a slight sound drew his attention to
the wabbly stand on the counter next to the post-office
proper, whereon was displayed a variety of picture
postal cards; “views” of Barford taken by the local
photographer, and offered generously to the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
at the rate of two for five cents. Intermingled with
the photographic representations of the village were
cards of a more general and decorative nature; impossibly
yellow Easter chickens, crosses, wreaths, and
baskets of flowers, in a variety of startling colors, and
lurking behind these in a manner suited to the time of
year (it being the month of April) were reminders of
a Christmas past, in the shape of stars, holly wreaths,
and churches, their lighted windows sparkling with
mica snows.</p>

<p>Before this varied collection a small boy, with a
scarlet tam perched on the back of his curly head,
stood gazing with longing eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh! hello there, bub!” observed Mr. Al Hewett
rebukingly. “You mustn’t touch them cards, y’
know.”</p>

<p>The boy stared at him from under puckered brows,
his rosy mouth half opened.</p>

<p>“What are they for?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Why, to sen’ to folks, Jimmy,” explained Mr.
Hewett, with a return of his wonted good humor.
“Easter greetings, views of our town, et cetery.
Want one t’ sen’ t’ y’r bes’ girl?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” said the child earnestly. “I want
one for&mdash;for Barb’ra. I want this one.”</p>

<p>He laid a proprietary hand on a Christmas tree
sparkling with tinsel lights and surmounted by the
legend, “I wish you a merry Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Well, son, that card’ll cost you a nickel, seein’
it’s early in the season,” responded the youth humorously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
“A nickel apiece; three fer ten. Shan’t I
wrap you up an Easter greetin’ an’ th’ Meth’dist
church along with it?”</p>

<p>The boy was engaged in untying a hard knot in
the corner of his handkerchief.</p>

<p>“I’ve got ten cents an’ a nickel,” he said. “An’
I want ten cents’ worth of m’lasses an’ the mail an’
that card. It’s my birfday,” he added proudly, “an’
Barb’ra said I could buy anything I wanted with the
nickel. She’s goin’ to make me some popcorn balls
with the m’lasses.”</p>

<p>“How old are you, Jimmy?” inquired the youth,
as he tied up the card in brown paper with a pink
string, and languidly deposited the nickel in the till.
“‘Bout a hunderd, I s’pose.”</p>

<p>“I’m six years old,” replied Jimmy importantly.
“An’ I’m large of my age; Barb’ra says so.”</p>

<p>“Then it mus’ be so, I reckon. Say, here’s a letter
fer Barb’ra f’om ’way out west. I’ve been wonderin’
who Barb’ra knows out west. Ever hear her
say, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>The boy shook his blond head vigorously, as he
bestowed the letter in the pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>“I’ll ask her if you want me to,” he said with a
friendly little smile.</p>

<p>But young Mr. Hewett was back at his post behind
the little window, where he presently became engaged
in brisk repartee with a couple of red-cheeked
girls over the non-arrival of a letter which one of
them appeared confidently to expect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Neither bestowed a glance upon the small figure
in the red cap which presently made its way out of
the door, carefully carrying a covered tin pail, and
out of whose shallow pocket protruded the half of a
thin blue envelope addressed to Miss Barbara Preston,
in a man’s bold angular hand.</p>

<p>There was a cold wind abroad, roaring through
the branches of the budding trees, and tossing the red
maple blossoms in a riotous blur of color against the
brilliant blue and white of the sky. To Jimmy Preston
trudging along the uneven sidewalk, where tiny
pools of water from the morning’s rain reflected the
sky and the tossing trees, like fragments of a broken
mirror, came a sense of singular elation. It was his
birthday; in one hand he carried the beautiful sparkling
card, and in the other the tin pail containing the
molasses; while in the dazzling reflections under foot
were infinite heights&mdash;infinite depths of mysterious
rapture.</p>

<p>“If I sh’d step in,” mused Jimmy, carefully skirting
the edges of a shallow uneven pool in the worn
stones, “‘s like’s not I’d go clear through to heaven.”</p>

<p>Heaven was a wonderful place, all flowers and
music and joyous ease. He knew this, because Barbara
had told him so; and nearly all of the family
were there&mdash;all but Barbara and himself. But there
might not be popcorn balls in heaven; Jimmy
couldn’t be certain on that point; and, anyway, he
concluded it was better to stay where Barbara was
and grow up to be a man as soon as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>The little boy broke into a manly whistle as he
pictured himself in a gray flannel shirt with his
trousers tucked into large boots, ploughing and calling
to the horses, the way Peg Morrison did.</p>

<p>The sidewalk came to an end presently, together
with the village street, just opposite the big house
of the Honorable Stephen Jarvis. Jimmy stopped,
as he always did, to look in through the convolutions
of a highly ornamental fence at the cast-iron deer
which guarded the walk on either side, and at the
mysterious blue glass balls mounted on pedestals,
which glistened brightly in a passing gleam of sunshine.
There were other things of interest in the
yard of the big house: groups of yellow daffodils,
nodding gaily in the wind, red, white, and purple
hyacinths behind the borders of blue-starred periwinkle,
and shrubs with clouds of pink and yellow
blossoms. In the summer there would be red geraniums
and flaming cannas and pampas grass in tall
fleecy pyramids. Jimmy wondered what it would
be like to walk up the long smooth gravel path and
open the tall front door. What splendors might be
hid behind the lace curtains looped away from the
shining windows; books, maybe, with pictures; a real
piano with ivory keys, and chairs and sofas of red
velvet.</p>

<p>“S’pos’n,” said Jimmy to his sociable little self,
“jus’ s’pos’n me an’ Barb’ra lived there; an’ I should
walk right in an’ find Barb’ra all dressed in a pink
satin dress with a trail an’ maybe a diamon’ crown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
She’d look lovely in a diamon’ crown, Barb’ra
would.”</p>

<p>His attention was diverted at the moment by the
sight of a smart sidebar buggy, drawn by a spirited
bay horse, which a groom was driving around the
house from the stable at the rear. The man pulled
up sharply at the side entrance, where the bay horse
pawed the gravel impatiently. Jimmy observed with
interest that the horse’s tail was cropped short and
bobbed about excitedly.</p>

<p>He was imagining himself as coming out of the
house and climbing into the shining buggy, and taking
the reins in his own hands, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He waited breathlessly, his eyes glued to an opening
in the fence, while the tall spare figure of a man
wearing a gray overcoat and a gray felt hat emerged
from the house.</p>

<p>Jimmy recognized the man at once. He was the
Honorable Stephen Jarvis. Few persons in Barford
ever spoke of him in any other way. “The
Honorable” seemed as much a part of his name as
Jarvis. Jimmy, for one, thought it was.</p>

<p>“That’s me!” said Jimmy. “Now I’m climbin’
in; now I’ve took the lines! Now I’ve got the whip!
And now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The vehicle dashed out of the open gate, whirred
past with a spatter of half-frozen mud, and disappeared
around a bend of the road where pollarded
willows grew.</p>

<p>“My! I’m goin’ fast!” said Jimmy aloud. “But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
I ain’t afraid; no, sir! I guess Barb’ra’ll be some
s’prised when she sees me drivin’ in! I’ll say, ‘Come
on an’ take a ride with me, Barb’ra’; an’ Barb’ra,
she’ll say, ‘Why, Jimmy Preston! ain’t you ’fraid
that short-tailed horse’ll run away?’ An’ I’ll laugh
an’ say, ‘Don’t you see I’m drivin’?’”</p>

<p>The laugh at least was real, and it rang out in a
series of rollicking chuckles, as the child resumed his
slow progress with the pail of molasses which had
begun to ooze sticky sweetness around the edge.
Observing this, Jimmy set it down and applied a cautious
finger to the overflow; from thence to his mouth
was a short distance, with results of such surprising
satisfaction that the entire circumference of the pail
was carefully gone over. “I guess,” reflected Jimmy
gravely, “that I’d better hurry now. Barb’ra’ll be
expectin’ me.”</p>

<p>A more rapid rate of progress brought about a
recrudescence of the oozing sweetness which, manifestly,
involved a repetition of salvage. By this time
Jimmy had reached and passed the row of willows,
cut back every spring to the gnarled stumps which
vaguely reminded the child of a row of misshapen
dwarfs; enchanted, maybe, and rooted to the ground
like gnomes in the fairy-tales. Beyond the distorted
willows, with their bunched osiers just budding into a
mist of yellowish green, was the bridge with its three
loose planks which rattled loud and hollow when a
trotting horse passed over, and responded to the light
footfalls of the child with a faint, intermittent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
creaking. On either side of the brook, swollen now
to a muddy torrent with the spring rains, grew crisp
green clumps of the skunk cabbage, interspersed with
yellow adders’ tongues and the elusive pink and white
of clustered spring-beauties.</p>

<p>“If I sh’d take Barb’ra some flowers, I guess she’d
be glad,” communed Jimmy with himself. “I’m
mos’ sure Barb’ra’d be awful glad to have some of
those yellow flowers; she likes yellow flowers, Barb’ra
does.”</p>

<p>He climbed down carefully, because of the molasses
which seemed to seethe and bubble ever more joyously
within the narrow confines of the tin pail, and
having arrived at the creek bottom he set down the
pail by a big stone and proceeded to fill his hands
with pink and yellow blossoms. It was pleasant
down by the brook, with the wind roaring overhead
like a friendly giant, and the blue sky and hurrying
white clouds reflected in the still places of the stream.</p>

<p>A thunder of hoofs and wheels sounded on the
bridge, and the child looked up to see the round red
face of Peg Morrison, and the curl of his whip-lash
as he called to his horses.</p>

<p>“Hello, Peg!” shouted Jimmy, “wait an’ le’ me
get in!” He caught up the pail and clambered briskly
up the steep bank.</p>

<p>The man had drawn up his horses, his puckered
eyes and puckered lips smiling down at the little
boy.</p>

<p>“Wall, I d’clar!” he called out in a high cracked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
voice, “if this ’ere ain’t the Cap’n! Where’d you
come f’om, Cap’n? Here, I’ll take your pail.”</p>

<p>“It’s got molasses in it, so you’d better be careful,”
warned Jimmy. “I’m goin’ to have six popcorn
balls an’ one to grow on, ’cause it’s my birfday an’
I’m large of my age.”</p>

<p>“Wall, now, I d’clar!” cried Peg admiringly, “so
you be, now I come to think of it, Cap’n. You’re
hefty, too&mdash;big an’ hefty.”</p>

<p>He pulled the little boy up beside him with a grunt
as of a mighty effort. As he did so the blue letter
slipped out of the small pocket, which was only half
big enough to hold it, and dropped unnoticed to the
ground. Then the wagon with a creak and a rattle
started on once more.</p>

<p>“You c’n see,” said Peg gravely, “how the horses
hes to pull now’t you’re in.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t they have to pull’s hard as that before I
got in?” inquired Jimmy. “Honest, Peg, didn’t
they?”</p>

<p>“Why, all you’ve got to do is to look at ’em,
Cap’n,” chuckled Peg. “I’m glad it ain’t fur or
they’d git all tuckered out, an’ I’ve got to plough
to-day. Say, Cap’n, the wind’s blowin’ fer business
ain’t it? You’d better look out fer that military
hat o’ your’n.”</p>

<p>“It does blow pretty hard,” admitted Jimmy;
“but my hat’s on tight.”</p>

<p>He glanced back vaguely to see a glimmer of
something blue skidding sidewise across the road into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the tangle of huckleberry and hard-hack bushes; then
he turned once more to the man at his side.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a birfday present for Barb’ra,” he said
eagerly.</p>

<p>“A birthday present fer Barb’ry? ’Tain’t her
birthday, too, is it?” inquired Peg, clucking to his
horses.</p>

<p>“No, it’s my birfday; but I got Barb’ra a birfday
present with my fi’ cents. I’m six.”</p>

<p>“Sure!” cried Peg. “Anybody’d know you was
six, Cap’n, jus’ to look at you! Six, an’ large an’
hefty fer your age. You bet they would! What
sort of birthday present did you get for Barb’ry&mdash;hey?”</p>

<p>“If you’ll keep the molasses from spillin’ over I’ll
show it to you,” offered Jimmy. “It’s a beautiful
picture.”</p>

<p>“Wall, now I vow!” exclaimed Peg, when the pink
string had been carefully untied and the sparkling
Christmas tree exposed to view. “‘I wish you a
merry Christmas,’” he read slowly. “Say, that’s
great, Cap’n! Mos’ folks fergit all about merry
Christmas long before spring. But they hadn’t
ought to. Stan’s to reason they hadn’t. They’d
ought to be merrier in April ’an in December, ’cause
the goin’s better an’ it’s ’nuffsight pleasanter
weather. I’ll bet Barb’ry’ll be tickled ha’f to death
when she sees that.”</p>

<p>“It sparkles, don’t it, Peg?”</p>

<p>“Mos’ puts my eyes out,” acquiesced the man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
“It’s all kin’s an’ colors o’ sparkles. It cert’ly is a
neligant present. D’ye want to drive while I do it
up fer ye?”</p>

<p>Jimmy took the reins.</p>

<p>“I won’t let ’em run away,” he said gravely.</p>

<p>“Run away?” chuckled Peg. “I’d like to see
’em run away with you a-holt o’ the lines. They
wouldn’t das to try it.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose I’ll be able to work the farm before
long, Peg,” observed Jimmy, after a short silence,
during which he sternly eyed the bobbing heads of the
old farm horses. “I’m pretty old now, an’ I’m
gettin’ taller every day.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” grumbled Mr. Morrison. “I guess the’
ain’t no ’special hurry ’bout your takin’ charge o’
the farm, Cap’n. Me an Barb’ry’s makin’ out pretty
well; an’ you know, Cap’n, you’ve got to go to school
quite a spell yet.”</p>

<p>Jimmy knit his forehead.</p>

<p>“I guess there is some hurry,” he said slowly.
“I’ve got to grow up’s quick’s I can.”</p>

<p>The man looked down at the valiant little figure at
his side with a queer twist of his weather-beaten face.</p>

<p>“Did&mdash;Barb’ry tell you that?” he wanted to know
after a short silence.</p>

<p>“No,” said Jimmy, shaking his head, “Barb’ra
didn’t tell me. I&mdash;just thinked it. You see, it’s
this way,” he went on, with a serious grown-up air,
“I’m all Barb’ra’s got, an’ Barb’ra’s all I’ve got.
We’ve just got each other; an’&mdash;an’&mdash;the farm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Peg pursed up his lips in an inaudible whistle.
“You wasn’t thinkin’ of givin’ up the farm&mdash;you an’
Barb’ry; was you?” he inquired presently.</p>

<p>“What? Me an’ Barb’ra give up the&mdash;farm?”
echoed Jimmy, in a shocked little voice. “Why&mdash;we
couldn’t do that.”</p>

<p>“Seein’ the’s jus’ th’ two of you, Cap’n&mdash;you an’
Barb’ry, an’&mdash;an’&mdash;the farm, I didn’t know but what
you was calc’latin’ t’ move int’ th’ village, where the’s
more folks, an’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Jimmy shook his blond head vigorously.</p>

<p>“We couldn’t live anywhere else,” he said decidedly.
“It’s&mdash;why, it’s our home!”</p>

<p>Peg had taken the reins and the wagon jolted
noisily between the tall stone gate-posts, past the big
elms and the groups of untrimmed evergreens, to
where the house stood on its low grassy terrace, a
gravelled driveway encircling it. It was a wide, low,
old-fashioned house with narrow porches and small-paned
windows, glittering in the sun like little fires.
Obviously the house had not been painted for a long
time; and its once dazzling walls and green shutters
had softened with time and uncounted storms into a
warm silvery gray which lent a certain dignity to its
square outlines.</p>

<p>Jimmy climbed down over the wheel and dashed
excitedly into the house.</p>

<p>“I’ve come, Barb’ra!” he shouted imperiously.
“Where are you, Barb’ra?”</p>

<p>The door of the sitting-room opened and a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
woman came out. She was tall and slender, with
masses of warm brown hair, a red mouth, and a
brilliantly clear pale skin; her gray eyes under their
long dark lashes were wide and angry, but they softened
as they fell upon the small figure in the red tam.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a neligant birfday present f’r you,
Barb’ra,” announced the little boy loudly. “An’
I’ve got a quart of m’lasses an’ I’ve got a letter
f’om way out west. An’ Al Hewett he wants to
know&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush, Jimmy,” said the girl, stooping to kiss the
child’s red mouth. “There’s&mdash;someone here. I&mdash;can’t
stop now. Go and get warm in the kitchen.
I’ll come presently.”</p>

<p>She opened a door peremptorily and the child
passed through it, his bright face clouded with disappointment.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to see your&mdash;birfday present,
even?” he demanded with quivering lips. “I
bought it with my fi’ cents, an’ it’s&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But the girl had already closed the door behind
her; he could hear her speak to someone in the
sitting-room. There followed the sound of a man’s
voice, speaking at length, and the low-toned murmur
of a brief reply. Jimmy laid the small flat parcel
containing the postal card on the kitchen table, and
set the pail of molasses on a chair. There was a
froth of sweetness all around the edge now, but Jimmy
didn’t care. Vaguely heavy at heart he walked over
to the window and looked out. Hitched to the post<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
near the lilac bushes was a tall bay horse with a
cropped tail. Behind the horse was a shining sidebar
buggy with red wheels. The horse was stretching
his sleek neck in an effort to reach the tender green
shoots of the lilac bushes, his cropped tail switching
irritably from side to side. Jimmy stared with round
eyes.</p>

<p>Presently the side door opened and Stephen Jarvis
came out quickly, jamming his gray felt hat low
upon his forehead. He untied the horse, jerking the
animal’s head impatiently to one side as he did so,
and stepped to the high seat; then, at a savage cut
of the whip, the horse darted away, the gravel spurting
from under his angry hoof-beats.</p>

<p>“I’m glad I’m not that horse,” mused Jimmy,
“an’ I’m glad&mdash;” he added, after a minute’s reflection&mdash;“‘at
I’m not&mdash;him.”</p>

<p>He was still thinking confusedly about the short-tailed
horse and his owner, when he heard Barbara’s
step behind him.</p>

<p>The girl stooped, put both arms about the little
boy, and laid her hot cheek on his. Then she
laughed, rather unsteadily.</p>

<p>“Kiss me quick, Jimmy Preston!” she cried. “I
want to be loved&mdash;hard!”</p>

<p>The child threw both arms fervently about his sister’s
neck. “I love you,” he declared circumstantially,
“wiv all my outsides an’ all my insides!
I love you harder’n anyfing!”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">II</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">For</span> a long time (it seemed to Jimmy) after the
last hoof-beat of the ill-tempered horse with the
cropped tail had died away on the gravelled drive
Barbara sat with the child in her arms, his curly
head close against her cheek; her gray eyes bright
with tears resolutely held in check.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you gettin’ some tired of holdin’ me?” inquired
Jimmy, with a stealthy little wriggle of protest.
“You know I’m six, an’ Peg says I’m hefty
for my age.”</p>

<p>Barbara laughed faintly, and the little boy slipped
from her arms with alacrity and stood before her,
eyeing her searchingly.</p>

<p>“I bought you a birfday present with my fi’
cents,” he said, “but you wouldn’t wait to see
it.”</p>

<p>“You bought me a birthday present?” cried Barbara.
“Why, Jimmy Preston! Show it to me; I
can’t wait a minute longer.”</p>

<p>Jimmy walked soberly across to the table. The
first glow of his enthusiasm had vanished, and he
frowned a little as he untied the pink string.</p>

<p>“Maybe you won’t like it,” he said modestly.
“It’s a picture, an’&mdash;an’ it&mdash;sparkles. I fought&mdash;no;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
I mean I <i>thought</i> it was pretty, an’ that you’d
like it, Barb’ra.”</p>

<p>“Like it, boy! I should say so! It’s the most
beautiful birthday present I ever had.” Barbara
spoke with convincing sincerity and her eyes suddenly
wrinkled with fun&mdash;the fun Jimmy loved. “I’d
really like to kiss you six times&mdash;and one to grow on,
if you’ll allow me, sir,” she said.</p>

<p>Jimmy considered this proposition for awhile in
silence. “You don’t kiss Peg,” he objected at last.</p>

<p>“Mercy no! I should hope not!” laughed Barbara.</p>

<p>She seized the child firmly and planted four of the
seven kisses on his hard pink cheeks. “Now two
more under your curls in the sweet place,” she murmured.
“And the last one in the sweetest place of
all!” And she turned up his round chin and sought
the warm white hollow beneath like a homing bee.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll be some sweeter after I eat six popcorn
balls,” observed Jimmy, disengaging himself.
“The molasses didn’t spill much.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad of that!” cried Barbara. “I
guess I’d better get to work. You run out and
bring in some chips from the woodpile, and I’ll have
that molasses boiling before you can spell Jack Robinson.”</p>

<p>“J-a-c-k,” began Jimmy triumphantly; but Barbara
chased him out of doors with a sudden access of
pretended severity.</p>

<p>“You’re getting altogether too clever for me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Jimmy Preston!” she said. Then her face clouded
swiftly at the recollection of Stephen Jarvis’s parting
words.</p>

<p>“What do you propose to do with the boy?” he
had asked.</p>

<p>“Take care of him,” she had replied defiantly,
“and save the farm for him.”</p>

<p>It was then that Jarvis had risen, crushing his
gray felt hat angrily between his hands.</p>

<p>“You’re likely to find it impossible to do either
the one or the other,” he said coldly. “The boy is
a chip of the old block. As for the farm, I’ve been
trying to make you understand for the last half hour
that it does not belong to you, unless you can meet
the payments before the date I set; and you’ve just
told me you can’t do that.”</p>

<p>“Let me pop the corn, Barb’ra!” begged Jimmy,
sniffing ecstatically at the molasses which was beginning
to seethe and bubble fragrantly in the little
round kettle. “I like birfdays,” he went on sociably;
“don’t; you, Barb’ra? I mean I like <i>birthdays</i>.
Did I say that right, Barb’ra?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” said his sister absent-mindedly. She
was drawing out the little round mahogany table.
“I’m going to put on the pink china,” she announced,
with a defiant toss of her dark head. The defiance
was for the Honorable Stephen Jarvis.</p>

<p>“It’s beginning to pop!” cried Jimmy excitedly,
as he drew the corn-popper back and forth on the
hot griddles with a busy scratching sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t let it burn,” warned Barbara. “How
would you like some little hot biscuits, Jimmy, and
some strawberry preserves?”</p>

<p>“Strawberry ’serves?” he echoed. “I didn’t
know we had any ’serves.”</p>

<p>“Well, we have. I’ve been saving ’em for&mdash;for
your birthday, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m glad!” cried the little boy, redoubling
his efforts. “See me work, Barb’ra. Don’t I work
hard?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, dear.” She hesitated, then added in
a low voice, “You always will work hard; won’t you,
Jimmy?”</p>

<p>The child watched her gravely while she shook the
crisp white kernels into a bowl. He was thinking
of her question.</p>

<p>“Do you think I’ll have to go to school much
longer, Barb’ra?” he asked. “It takes such a long
time to go to school.”</p>

<p>The girl wheeled sharply about.</p>

<p>“What put that notion into your head?” she demanded.
“Of course you’ve got to go school till&mdash;till
you’re educated&mdash;like father.” Her voice
faltered a little, and a dark flush crept into her
cheeks.</p>

<p>The boy’s eyes were on her face.</p>

<p>“Of course father was&mdash;he was sick, Jimmy, sick
and unhappy. You don’t remember him as I do; but
he&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” the child said simply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he threw his arms about Barbara and hugged
her. He didn’t know why exactly, except that Barbara
liked his rough boyish caresses. And he wanted
to make her smile again.</p>

<p>She did smile, winking back the tears.</p>

<p>“I want you to study&mdash;hard, Jimmy,” she went
on in a low tremulous voice; “and grow to be a good
man&mdash;the best kind of a man. You must! I couldn’t
bear it, if you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t, Barb’ra,” promised the child
gravely. He eyed his sister with a sudden flash of
comprehension as he added stoutly, “You don’t have
to worry ’bout me. I’m growin’ jus’ ’s fas’ ’s I can,
an’ I know mos’ all my tables, ’ceptin’ seven an’ nine
an’ some of eight.”</p>

<p>Barbara laughed, and there was the same odd ring
of defiance in the sound. Then she opened a cupboard
in the wall and took out a cake covered with
pink icing.</p>

<p>Jimmy’s blue eyes grew wide with wonder.
“What’s that?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Barbara was setting six small candles around the
edge; last of all she planted one in the middle.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t guess if you tried,” she said gaily.
“I just know you couldn’t. You’re such a dull
boy.”</p>

<p>“I can guess, too!” cried Jimmy with a shout of
rapture. “It’s a cake! It’s my birfday cake! An’
it’s got six candles on it an’ one to grow on. I ’member
last year it had only five an’ one to grow on; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
I growed that one all up. I want Peg to see it. Can
I go out t’ the barn an’ get him? Can I,
Barb’ra?”</p>

<p>The girl hesitated as she cast a troubled eye on the
table set daintily with the pink china, and the few
carefully cherished bits of old silver.</p>

<p>“You may ask Peg to come in and have supper
with you, if you like,” she said slowly. “Just this
once&mdash;because it’s your birthday.”</p>

<p>Jimmy didn’t wait for a second bidding; he dashed
out of the back door with a boyish whoop, carefully
studied from the big boys in school.</p>

<p>Peg (shortened from Peleg) Morrison had worked
on the Preston farm for so many years that he appeared
almost as much a part of the place as the
shabby old house itself, or the rambling structures at
its rear known indeterminately as “the barns.” He
slept over the carriage-house, in quarters originally
intended for the coachman. Here also he cooked
handily for himself on a rusty old stove, compounding
what he called “tried an’ tested receipts” out of
a queer old yellow-leaved book bound in marbled
boards, its pages written over in Peg’s own scrawling
chirography.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t part with that thar book for its weight
in gold an’ di’mon’s,” he was in the habit of saying
solemnly to Jimmy. “No, Cap’n, I reelly wouldn’t.
I begun to write down useful inf’mation in it when I
wasn’t much bigger’n you be now, an’ I’ve kep’ it
up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“Vallable Information, by Peleg Morrison,” was
the legend inscribed on its thumbed cover. Jimmy
admired this book beyond words, and quite in private
had started one of his own on pieces of brown
paper accumulated in the attic chamber where he
played on rainy days.</p>

<p>“Hello, Cap’n!” observed Peg with a genial smile,
as the little boy thrust his yellow head in at the
door of his quarters. “Say! I do b’lieve you’ve
growed some since I seen you last. It must be them
popcorn balls, I reckon. Pop-corn’s mighty tasty
and nourishin’.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t eaten ’em&mdash;not yet!” said Jimmy
breathlessly. “An’, Peg, I’ve got a birfday cake&mdash;an’
it’s got six candles on it, an’ one to grow on; an’&mdash;an’
it’s all pink on top; an’ Barb’ra, she’s made a
whole lot of biscuits; an’ we’ve got some strawberry
’serves, an’&mdash;an’ we want you to come to supper; jus’
this once, ’cause it’s my birfday. Barb’ra said to
tell you. An’ she’s put on the pink dishes, too!”</p>

<p>“Wall, now, Cap’n, that surely is kind of Miss
Barb’ry. But you see I ain’t got my comp’ny clo’es
on. M’ swallow-tail coat’s got the rear buttons off,
an’ m’ high collar ’n boiled shirt’s to m’ wash-lady’s.”</p>

<p>Peg winked humorously at Jimmy, in token that
his remarks were to be interpreted as being in a
purely jocular vein.</p>

<p>“We don’t care ’bout clo’es&mdash;me an’ Barb’ra,”
said Jimmy, grandly. “An’ I want you to see my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
cake wiv the candles burning. I’m goin’ to blow ’em
out when we are all through wiv supper; then we’re
goin’ to eat the cake.”</p>

<p>“Wall, now I’ll tell you, Cap’n. I’ll mosey in
’long ’bout time you get t’ the cake. I wouldn’t miss
seein’ them candles blowed out fer anythin’. You c’n
tell Miss Barb’ry I’m obleeged to her fer th’ invitation&mdash;mind
you say Miss Barb’ry, Jimmy. ’Cause
that’s manners, seein’ I’m hired man on this ’ere
farm.”</p>

<p>“Does Barb’ra pay you lots o’ money?” asked
Jimmy, with sudden grave interest.</p>

<p>Peg puckered up his mouth judicially.</p>

<p>“You don’t want t’ git in th’ habit o’ askin’
pers’nal questions, Cap’n,” he said, with a serious look
in his kind old eyes. “‘Tain’t reelly p’lite, you know.
An’ the’s times when it’s kind o’ embarrassin’ to answer
’em. But, in this ’ere case, I’m pertickler glad
to tell you, Cap’n, that Barb’ry&mdash;I mean Miss
Barb’ry&mdash;does pay me all I ask fur, an’ a whole lot
besides. You see I hev special privileges here on
this place that ain’t come by ev’ry day, an’ I value
’em&mdash;I value ’em highly. An’ that reminds me,
Cap’n, that I’ve got a little present fer you, seein’
you’re six, goin’ on seven, an’ big an’ hefty fer your
age. Jest you clap yer eyes onto that an’ tell me
what you think of it. ’Tain’t what you’d call reelly
val’able now; but you keep it fer&mdash;say fifty years an’
do what I’ve done with mine, an’ money won’t buy it
f’om you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Peg!” gasped Jimmy, in a rapture too deep
and pervasive for words, “is it&mdash;a val’able inf’mation
book?”</p>

<p>“That’s what it is, Cap’n,” chuckled Peg, holding
off the book and gazing at it with honest pride. “Y’
see, I couldn’t find th’ mate to mine in looks; but this
’ere red cover beats mine all holler, an’ you see I’ve
put ‘Vallable Information by James Embury Preston’
on it in handsome red letters. Take it, boy, an’
don’t put nothin’ into it ’at won’t be true an’ useful,
is the prayer o’ Peg Morrison.”</p>

<p>The old man’s tone was solemn and his blue eyes
gleamed suddenly moist in the midst of their network
of wrinkles.</p>

<p>“The’s folks in this world,” he went on soberly,
“‘at would be mighty glad if they had a book like
that, full o’ tried an’ tested rules&mdash;fer conduct, as
well as fer hoss liniment an’ pies an’ cakes. In the
front page o’ mine I put down more’n twenty years
ago, ‘Never promise anythin’ that you ain’t willin’
to set ’bout doin’ the nex’ minute.’ That’s a good
sentiment fer man or beast. Ye c’n turn to a rule
fer mos’ anythin’, f’om what to do fer a colt ’at’s et
too much green clover, up to how to set on a jury.
But I’ve took my time to it, an’ ain’t never wrote anythin’
down jus’ t’ fill paper. Now you trot along,
Cap’n; an’ I’ll be with you before you git them
candles blowed out.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’d like to shake hands, Peg,” said Jimmy
fervently. “I’m too big an’ hefty to kiss people for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
thank you. But I like this book better’n anyfing&mdash;I
mean anything.”</p>

<p>He put out his small brown hand on which babyish
dimples still lingered, and the old man grasped and
shook it solemnly.</p>

<p>“You’re more’n welcome, Cap’n!” he said heartily.
“An’ thinkin’ y’ might like to set down a few sentiments
I got you a bottle o’ red ink an’ a new steel
pen. I like red ink m’self. It makes a handsome
page.”</p>

<p>“I never s’posed I’d have a whole bottle of red
ink,” said Jimmy, with a rapturous sigh of contentment
filled to the brim and running over. “Don’t
forget to come and see my cake,” he called out as
the old man convoyed him to the foot of the stairs
with a nautical lantern.</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ right back up to put on m’ swallow-tail,”
Peg assured him. “You’ll see me in ’bout
half an hour.”</p>

<p>Barbara knit her fine dark brows a little over the
birthday book with its quaint inscription.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t like you to suppose that was the way
to spell valuable information,” she said crisply.
“Suppose we put another card over this one, dear.
I’ll write it for you.”</p>

<p>Jimmy pondered this proposal in silence for a few
minutes, then he shook his head.</p>

<p>“I want my book to be ’zactly like Peg’s,” he said
firmly. “It’s a val’able inf’mation book; that’s what
it is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>He kept it by him all the while they were eating
their supper off the pink and white china Grandfather
Embury brought from foreign parts, while
the seven candles cast bright lights and wavering
shadows across the table on the boy’s rosy little face
and the girl’s darker beauty.</p>

<p>“Peg’s comin’ in’s soon’s he puts on his swallow-tail,”
said Jimmy placidly. “I like Peg better’n
anybody, ’ceptin’ you, Barb’ra. He’s so durned
square.”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t say such words, Jimmy,” Barbara
said, with a vexed pucker between her brows.
“You must remember that you are a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“So is Peg a gentleman,” said Jimmy, valiantly
ready to do battle for his friend. “An’ he says
durned.”</p>

<p>Barbara shook her head impatiently at the child.</p>

<p>“If you say that word again, Jimmy,” she threatened,
“I shall be obliged to forbid you going out to
the barn at all.”</p>

<p>“I guess you don’t mean that, Barb’ra,” the little
boy said firmly. “Course I have to go out to the
barn; but I promise I won’t say durned ’cept when I
plough.”</p>

<p>A sound of hard knuckles cautiously applied to
the back kitchen door announced Mr. Morrison, attired
in his best suit of rusty black, his abundant iron-gray
hair, ordinarily standing up around his ruddy,
good-humored face like a halo, severely plastered
down with soap and water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-evenin’, Cap’n,” he said ceremoniously, “I
hope you fin’ yourself in good health on this ’ere
auspicious occasion, sir; an’ you, too, Miss Barb’ry,
as a near relation of the Cap’n’s. I hope I see you
well an’&mdash;an’ happy, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“See my cake, Peg,” shouted Jimmy, capering
wildly about the old man. “See the candles!”</p>

<p>Peg pretended to shade his eyes from the overpowering
illumination. “Wall, now, I mus’ say!”
he exclaimed. “If that ain’t wo’th coverin’ ten miles
o’ bad goin’ t’ see. That cert’nly is a han’some cake,
Miss Barb’ry, an’ the Cap’n here tells me you made
it.”</p>

<p>Barbara smiled, rather sadly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “I made it. If you’ll blow out
the candles now, Jimmy, I’ll cut it and we’ll each
have a piece.”</p>

<p>The little boy climbed up in his chair.</p>

<p>“I have to sit down when I blow,” he said seriously,
and sent the first current of air across the
table from his puckered lips. “One of ’em’s out!”
he announced triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Give it to ’em agin, Cap’n!” cried Peg.
“Give ’em a good one. That’s right! Now the
nigh one’s gone; but that off candle’s a sticker.
I dunno whether you’ll fetch that one or not,
Cap’n.”</p>

<p>The child drew in a mighty breath, his puffed
cheeks flushing to a brilliant scarlet, and blew with
all his might, the flame of the one lighted candle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
waned, flared sidewise, and disappeared, leaving a
light wreath of smoke behind.</p>

<p>“There! I blowed ’em out, all by myself,” he
exulted. “I’ve got a strong wind in my breaf,
haven’t I, Peg?”</p>

<p>“I declar’, I’d hate to have you try it on the roof
o’ the barn, Cap’n. The loose shingles’d fly, I bet,”
Peg assured him jocularly.</p>

<p>Barbara was cutting the cake, her troubled eyes
bent upon her task. Mr. Morrison glanced at her
anxiously.</p>

<p>“I seen a rig hitched out t’ the side door this afternoon,”
he said slowly. “‘Twant a&mdash;a sewin’-machine
agent; was it, Miss Barb’ry?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the girl shortly; her look forbade
further questions.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you who ’twas, Peg,” said Jimmy sociably,
as he began to nibble the edges of his slice of
cake. “It was the Hon’rable Stephen Jarvis. An’
his horse’s tail is cut off short so’t it can’t switch
’round, an’ it makes him cross. I guess it would
make me some cross, too, if I was a horse. Wouldn’t
it make you, Peg?”</p>

<p>“I reckon’t would, Cap’n,” said the old man, fetching
a heavy sigh for no apparent reason. He turned
to Barbara, whose red lips were set in an expression
of haughty reserve.</p>

<p>“If I’d ’a’ knowed ’twas the Hon’rable Stephen
Jarvis fer certain,” he went on, with an effort after
careless ease of manner, “I b’lieve I’d ’a’ took the opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to talk over crops with him fer a spell.
We’re goin’ to have a first-rate crop o’ buckwheat
this year, an’ winter wheat’s lookin’ fine. The’d
ought to be plenty of apples, too. I pruned the
trees in the spring an’ manured ’em heavy last fall.”</p>

<p>Barbara gazed steadily at the table. She did not
answer.</p>

<p>“I was thinkin’ some o’ plantin’ onions in the five
acre field this year,” went on Peg, an agitated tremor
in his voice. “They’re a heap o’ work, onions is,
what with weedin’ ’em an’ cultivatin’ ’em; but the’s
big money in ’em; white, red, an’ yellow sorts. What
would you say to onions, Miss Barb’ry?”</p>

<p>“There’s no use,” said the girl, “of our planting&mdash;anything.”
She turned her back abruptly on pretence
of pulling down a window shade. “I’ll speak
to you to-morrow&mdash;about the work.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">III</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">After</span> Jimmy had said his prayers and was tucked
up in bed, tired but happy, the book of “Vallable
Information” under his pillow, Barbara sat for
awhile by the open window in the dusk of the April
night. The wind had gone down since sunset, and in
the stillness she could hear the “peepers,” singing in
the distant marshes, and the soft roar of the river,
filled to its brim with the melted snows from the hills.
Something in the sound of the swollen river and the
gleam of a single star, seen dimly between drifting
clouds, brought the remembrance of other April
nights to Barbara’s mind.</p>

<p>Her thoughts went back to the day when her
father, then a proud, handsome man in his prime, had
brought his new wife to the farm. Her own passionately
mourned mother seemed strangely forgotten in
the joy of the home-coming and the girl had resented
it in the dumb, pathetic fashion of childhood. After
a little, though, she had come to love the gentle
creature who had won her father’s heart. There
followed a few happy years, regretfully remembered
through a blur of tears, when the little mother, as
Barbara learned to call her, filled the old house to
overflowing with sunshine. Then on an April night
when the river lifted up its plaintive voice in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
stillness that fell after a wild, windy day, Jimmy
came, and the little mother went&mdash;hastily, as if summoned
out of the dark by some voice unheard by the
others. Barbara remembered well the night of her
going, and of how, with a last effort, she had lifted
the tiny baby and placed him in her own strong young
arms.</p>

<p>“Love&mdash;him&mdash;dear,” whispered the failing voice.
Then she had smiled once, as if with a great content,
and was gone.</p>

<p>Jimmy’s voice broke sleepily through these bitter-sweet
memories.</p>

<p>“Barb’ra!” he called, “are you there? I forgot
somethin’.”</p>

<p>“What did you forget, dear?” asked the girl, going
to his bed.</p>

<p>“I love you, Barb’ra!” murmured the little boy,
snuggling his hand in hers.</p>

<p>She stooped to kiss him all warm and sweet with
sleep. Then drew the blankets closer about his
shoulders.</p>

<p>“It was&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;letter,” the drowsily-sweet little
voice went on. “I&mdash;forgot&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Jimmy,” said Barbara the next morning, as she
brushed the child’s yellow hair, “what was it you
said last night about a letter?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I bringed&mdash;no, I brought a letter home to
you in my coat pocket, and I forgot to give it to
you.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t in either of your pockets, dear. I looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
there last night. Try and think what you did with
it.”</p>

<p>The little boy looked troubled.</p>

<p>“The man gave it to me, an’ it was blue. An’ he
said it was f’om way out west, an’ he asked me who
did you know out west; an’ I said I didn’t know; but
I’d ask you. I put it in my pocket.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it wasn’t anything important,” Barbara
said slowly, “but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, I guess it wasn’t,” agreed Jimmy placidly.
“Say, Barb’ra, can I have two popcorn balls to
take to school?”</p>

<p>“But what do you suppose became of the letter?”
persisted Barbara. “Which pocket did you put
it in?”</p>

<p>Jimmy eyed the small garment uncertainly.</p>

<p>“It was in this one,” he decided; “I ’member I
put the letter in my pocket an’ it stuck out, ’cause it
was too long.”</p>

<p>“Did you come straight home from the post-office?”
demanded Barbara. “Did you, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>Jimmy reflected.</p>

<p>“I walked along,” he said, “an’ ’nen I looked in
through the fence to see the deer an’ the shiny blue
round things&mdash;you know, Barb’ra, when the sun
shines you c’n see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know,” said the girl, with a touch of impatience.</p>

<p>“An’ ’nen I saw the horse wiv a short tail come
out, an’ I p’tended I was drivin’ an’ goin’ awful fast!
But I couldn’t trot real fas’ because the m’lasses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
spilled. I had to stop an’ lick it off lots of
times.”</p>

<p>“Why, Jimmy!” said the girl rebukingly.</p>

<p>“Wiv my fingers,” explained Jimmy mildly. “You
know you have to do something when it comes out all
bubbles ’round the edge; an’&mdash;an’ ’nen I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You must have dropped the letter somewhere
along the road,” interrupted his sister.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh! I guess I did,” assented the culprit.
“But I didn’t mean to, Barb’ra. Truly I didn’t.”</p>

<p>His lip quivered as he looked up at her stormy
face.</p>

<p>The girl controlled herself with an effort.</p>

<p>“Of course you didn’t mean to, darling,” she said,
kissing the rosy mouth, which had begun to droop
dolefully at the corners. “Perhaps it was just an
advertisement, anyway, and not worth bothering over.
I’ll walk along with you and see if we can find it.”</p>

<p>But the letter, snugly hidden under a clump of
unfolding fern, gave no token of its presence as the
two walked slowly past it, their eyes searching the
road and the tangled growths on either side.</p>

<p>Barbara walked swiftly to the post-office, after she
had left Jimmy at the schoolhouse. It had occurred
to her that someone might have returned the missing
letter to the office.</p>

<p>Al Hewett, when questioned, shook his head.</p>

<p>“Nope,” he said, “the’ ain’t nobody brought it
here. ’Course I’d ’a’ saved it fer you if they had.
I remember the letter all right, I happened to notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the postmark. It was fo’m Tombstone, Arizony.
Know anybody out there?”</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. “Was there any
printing&mdash;or&mdash;writing on the envelope?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Not that I recall,” said Mr. Hewlett, mindful
of his official state. “Of course you understan’ with
the amount of mail we handle in this office that we
couldn’t be expected to notice any one letter in pertickler.
I’m real sorry, Barb’ra,” he added, with
genuine good feeling. “Jimmy’s pretty small t’
deliver mail. He’s a nice little shaver, though.
Anythin’ in the line o’ groceries to-day?”</p>

<p>“Not to-day,” said Barbara, her cheeks flushing.</p>

<p>Then she looked up with sudden determination.
“Is your father here?” she asked, in a low voice.
“If he is&mdash;I’d like to see him.”</p>

<p>“Pa’s in the back room makin’ up accounts,” the
younger Hewett informed her. “I’ll call him, if
you say so.&mdash;Pa!”</p>

<p>“No; don’t, please,” objected Barbara hastily.
“I’ll go and speak to him there.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Abram Hewett had already appeared in
answer to the summons and was advancing briskly
behind a counter gay with new prints and ginghams.
His face stiffened at sight of Barbara, and he darted
an impatient look at his son.</p>

<p>“Could I speak with you&mdash;just a moment, Mr.
Hewett?” asked Barbara, in a low, determined voice,
“on business?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>The man coldly scrutinized the flushed face the
girl lifted to his.</p>

<p>“If it was ’bout the balance o’ that account o’
yours&mdash;&mdash;” he began, “I was just lookin’ it over,
’long with some others like it. You c’n come in
here.”</p>

<p>Barbara followed his short, bent figure, her heart
beating heavily. But she had found a remnant of
her vanished self-possession by the time Mr. Hewett
had climbed to the high stool behind the long-legged
desk, which represented the financial centre of the
establishment. “Well?” he said interrogatively, fixing
his lowering regard upon her.</p>

<p>Barbara glanced at the two fly-specked legends
which flanked the desk on either side, reading respectively,
“My time is money; don’t steal it,” and
“This is my busy day.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t come to finish paying that bill to-day,”
she said, a flush of shame mounting to her forehead.
“But the hens are beginning to lay now, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Eggs is cheap an’ plentiful,” demurred Mr.
Hewett, with unconcealed impatience. “I couldn’t
agree t’ allow ye much on eggs.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t the bill I came to see you about,” said
Barbara, with a proud look at him. “I shall pay it
in money as soon as I possibly can.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” interjected Mr. Hewett. Then he added
sharply “Humph!” drumming meanwhile on the lid
of his desk to denote the lapse of unfruitful minutes.</p>

<p>Barbara still hesitated, while she strove to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
words to introduce the difficult business she had in
mind.</p>

<p>Mr. Hewett cleared his throat suggestively.</p>

<p>“There’s a mortgage on the farm,” she said slowly,
“and we’re going to lose it, unless&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Unless you pay up,” suggested Mr. Hewett
briskly. “Yes; jes’ so. I’ve been wonderin’ how
you managed to hang on to it s’ long’s you have.”</p>

<p>“I’ve worked,” said Barbara, in a low, tense voice.
“I’ve worked early and late, ever since father died,
and before that. But&mdash;there was unpaid interest,
and interest on that; and last year the apples failed,
and so&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He’s goin’ to foreclose on ye. Yes, yes; exac’ly.
I s’pose likely Jarvis holds the mortgage?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Barbara breathlessly. “But if I
only had a little more time I could manage it&mdash;somehow.
I must keep the farm for Jimmy. I promised
father he should have it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hewett was silent, his plump face drawn into
the semblance of a dubious smile.</p>

<p>“I’ve come to ask you to take up the mortgage for
me, and give me more time to pay it. Will you do
it?” asked Barbara, avoiding the man’s look.</p>

<p>Mr. Hewett shifted his gaze to the ink-well, around
the edge of which a lean black fly was crawling
dispiritedly.</p>

<p>“W’y, no,” he said decidedly. “I shouldn’t like
to interfere; I couldn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“Why couldn’t you?” demanded Barbara. “If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
we have a good apple year, I could pay the mortgage
in two years. It doesn’t cost us much to live.”</p>

<p>“If it’s a good apple year, apples’ll be a drug
on the market,” Mr. Hewett prophesied gloomily.
“Nope! I’m sorry; but I guess you’ll have to let
Jarvis foreclose on ye. I shouldn’t like to run up
against Jarvis, y’ know.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;there’s Jimmy!” The girl’s voice rang
out in a sharp cry.</p>

<p>“Put the boy in an institootion, or bind him out,”
advised Mr. Hewett, drumming impatiently on the
lid of his desk. “The’s folk a-plenty that wouldn’t
mind raisin’ a healthy boy to work.”</p>

<p>Barbara turned swiftly.</p>

<p>“Say!” called Mr. Hewett; “hold on a minute!”
Then, as Barbara paused, “This ’ere account’s
been standin’ since long before your pa died.
I’ve been pretty easy on you to date, but I guess I’ll
have to attach somethin’ before Jarvis gits his hold
onto things. You’ve got some stock, I b’lieve,
an’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But Barbara was already out of hearing, hurrying
as if pursued. Two or three women, looking over
dress goods at the counter, turned to look after
the slim figure in its black dress.</p>

<p>“She don’t ’pear to see common folks any better’n
her father did,” said one, with a spiteful laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see’s she’s got much to be stuck
up about,” put in another. “What with her father
drinkin’ himself to death, an’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“Was that what ailed him?” inquired a newcomer
in the neighborhood. “I remember he was
buried a year ago last winter, just after we moved
here. But I never heard he was a drinking man.”</p>

<p>“None of us suspicioned it for quite a spell,” explained
the first speaker volubly. “Donald Preston
was too awful stylish and uppity to go to the tavern
an’ get drunk like common folks; he used to sen’
for his liquor f’om out of town. The best of brandy,
so they say; then he’d drink, an’ drink till he was
dead to the world, shut up in his room. He kind of
lost his mind ’long toward the last, they say. He
lived more’n two years that way ’fore he finally
died.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t take care of him like that, did she?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she did. Her an’ the hired man; an’ I guess
they had their hands full part the time. He used to
cry an’ holler nights like a baby towards the last.
Me an’ Mr. Robinson heard him once when we was
comin’ home f’om a revival meetin’ over to the Corners.
Seth, he was for stoppin’ an’ seein’ if there
was anythin’ we could do, but I says, ‘No, I don’t
want to mix up in it,’ I says. Afterwards I was kind
of sorry; I’d like to have seen the upstairs rooms in
that house.”</p>

<p>The subject of these manifold revelations and
censures was walking rapidly down the village street,
her mind a maze of unhappy reflections. She stopped
short at the end of the sidewalk, as Jimmy had done
the day before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t suppose there’s any use,” she thought,
her eyes fixed on the imposing front which the Jarvis
residence presented to the public gaze. “But I’ll
try, anyway. If he’d give me a year&mdash;or even six
months longer, I’m sure I could get the interest paid
up.”</p>

<p>Without waiting for her elusive courage to vanish
into thin air the girl pushed open the front gate,
which clanged decisively shut behind her. The harsh
metallic sound appeared to pursue her relentlessly
up the long gravelled walk, past the stiff figures of
the cast-iron deer, past the blossoming shrubs and the
glittering blue glass globes&mdash;quite up to the pillared
entrance. A sour-faced woman opened the door.</p>

<p>Mr. Jarvis was at home, she informed Barbara.
“But he’s busy,” she added importantly. “The’
can’t nobody see him this mornin’, an’ he’s goin’ away
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Then I must see him,” Barbara said firmly.
“Tell Mr. Jarvis that Miss Preston would like to
see him&mdash;on&mdash;on business.”</p>

<p>Stephen Jarvis had spent several hours shut up in
his library that morning, during which period he had
opened and examined his mail, read the morning
papers, published in a neighboring city, and the
county papers, one of which he owned, and whose
editorial utterances he controlled.</p>

<p>The morning sun, streaming cheerfully through the
clear windows, lay across his paper-strewn desk,
bringing into prominence its handsome fittings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the large sinewy hand which reached purposefully
for a pen. As he sat there in the revealing light
Stephen Jarvis appeared very nearly what he had
made of himself in the course of some thirty laborious
years. Nature had provided him with a big-boned,
powerful body, topped by a head in no wise remarkable
for its beauty, yet significant as the compact
rounded end of a steel projectile; eyes of no particular
color, deep-set beneath penthouse brows; a nose,
high in its bony structure, curving at the tip, with a
suggestion of scorn; a jaw, heavy but clear-cut, well
furnished with strong, even teeth. Jarvis was born
a farmer’s son, poor with the poverty of sparse
acres, sparsely cultivated through successive generations
of uncalculating, simple-hearted men, content
to live and die as had their forbears. It was far
otherwise with Stephen Jarvis. His initial conclusion,
derived from keen-eyed observation and comparison,
resulted in an active hatred of the grinding
poverty his fathers had accepted with settled stoicism
as the common lot. He would not, he resolved,
remain poor. He would in some way&mdash;in any way&mdash;acquire
houses, lands, money. This single idea,
planted, rooted, and grown mighty, brought forth
fruit after its kind. In ten years’ time he had
climbed out of the walled pit where he had found
himself; in the decade which followed, having
learned, experimentally, of the compelling power of
the fixed idea doggedly adhered to, he had gone on,
adding more houses, more lands, more money to what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
he already possessed; and this process having by now
become somewhat monotonously easy, he had reached
for and seized political power of the sort most easily
grasped by the large hand of wealth. He still continued
almost mechanically to loan money at a high
rate of interest, to execute and foreclose mortgages,
but there was no longer zest or excitement in
the game. And there intervened disquieting moments
like the present when he perceived that, after all, he
was not successful, as the world counted success; nor
rich, as the world counted wealth; moments when he
realized his loneliness and the coldness of his hearth-stone,
where neither friends nor children gathered.</p>

<p>His wife, dead more than two years, had been a
dull, emotionless woman, with a flat, pale, expressionless
face and a high-shouldered, angular figure.
Jarvis had married her without pretence of passion
because she had money, and in his poverty-pinched
youth he had thought of little else. He had
never been unkind to the woman who bore his name.
He had, in fact, paid very little attention to her, and
she had trodden the dull round of her existence unprotestingly
and died as unobtrusively as she had
lived. A portrait of the late Mrs. Jarvis in the cold
medium of black and white crayons, hung above the
mantel. The man’s eyes rested upon it mechanically
as he lifted them from the dull report of a dully
rancorous speech delivered on a late public occasion
by his political opponent in the county. The portrait
failed to arouse memories either sweet or bitter;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
but Jarvis observed that his housekeeper in her annual
spring cleaning had taken the pains to protect
the picture in its showy, expensive frame. He
frowned as he noticed the barred pink netting from
behind which his wife’s plain features looked forth
with a suggestion of pained protest. The effect was
distinctly unpleasing. He caught himself wondering
irritably why the picture should confront him thus;
portraits were foolish, unmeaning things, anyway;
shrouded with pink tarlatan they became impossible.
His gaze still lingered frowningly upon the picture
when there came a dubious tap upon the panels of
the door.</p>

<p>“What d’you want?” demanded Jarvis sharply, as
he recognized the intruder. “I thought I told you
not to disturb me this morning.”</p>

<p>“Well, I told her so; but she wouldn’t go away,”
the woman apologized. “I guess ’f I let her stan’
there till she’s good an’ tired o’ waitin’, she’ll&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Kindly acquaint me with the name of the person
who wishes to see me, Mrs. Dumser,” he interrupted,
with a quick, choleric lift of the hand.</p>

<p>“It’s that Preston girl,” the woman said sullenly.
“I told her you was busy and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Show her in at once,” her employer ordered
briefly. On the whole he welcomed the interruption.
There was a certain excitement akin to that experienced
by the sportsman when he subdues some struggling
wild creature to his will. It was a species of
weak folly, he told himself, to entertain anything like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
compassion for borrowers of money who could not
pay. And Stephen Jarvis was not a weak man. He
was, moreover, thoroughly familiar with all the various
excuses, subterfuges and pitiful expedients of
such luckless individuals, as well as complete master
of the final processes by which he was wont to detach
them from their forfeited possessions. His mouth,
long, straight, expressionless, and shaded by a
closely clipped mustache, tightened as Barbara
Preston entered.</p>

<p>He glanced at her sharply as the girl sank into
a chair opposite the desk without waiting to be
asked.</p>

<p>The light from the long French windows fell full
upon the slender young figure in its plain black
gown, and her face, seen against the sombre background
afforded by rows of leather-bound law-books,
appeared vividly alive, defiantly youthful, like a
spray of peach blossoms against a leaden sky.</p>

<p>“You wished to see me, I believe,” said Jarvis,
perceiving that the girl was struggling with involuntary
fear of him, a fear heightened by her surroundings.
“What can I do for you?”</p>

<p>She met his gaze unflinchingly.</p>

<p>“I have come,” she said, “to see if you will give
me a little more time. It is going to be a good apple
year, and&mdash;and I’ll work&mdash;hard to save the farm.”</p>

<p>Her eyes darkened and widened; a quick color
sprang to lips and cheeks, as when a flag is suddenly
unfurled to the wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you’ll only give me a chance!” she cried.</p>

<p>“What sort of a chance are you looking for?” he
wanted to know.</p>

<p>Barbara’s eyes fell before his steady gaze.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;want&mdash;&mdash;” she began, and stopped, obviously
searching for forgotten words and phrases.</p>

<p>He waited imperturbably for her to go on.</p>

<p>“I want you to let me stay&mdash;in my home.”</p>

<p>He lifted his eyebrows.</p>

<p>“I thought we discussed that matter pretty thoroughly
yesterday afternoon,” he said. “I can think
of nothing more to say on the subject.”</p>

<p>“But,” she persisted, “I don’t intend to give it
up. I&mdash;can’t.”</p>

<p>He was silent. But his look angered her unreasonably.</p>

<p>“You don’t want the farm!” she burst out, with
sudden hot indignation. “You’ve got most of the
farms about here now, and you’ll have the others in
time, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“You appear to know a good deal about my
business,” he said ironically. “But you’re right. I
don’t want the Preston farm. I don’t want any of
’em. Why should I? Most of them are like yours,
worn out, worthless. But the owners want my money&mdash;your
father did. And I let him have what he
asked for. I might have refused. But I let him have
a thousand dollars, and he took it, did as he liked
with it&mdash;drank it up, for all I know. And now you
come here begging&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl sprang to her feet; her gray eyes blazed
angrily upon him.</p>

<p>“I’m not begging!” she cried. “All I want is the
chance to pay you&mdash;every cent, and I could do it&mdash;I
will do it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will tell me how you are going about
it,” he said coldly.</p>

<p>She sank back into her chair.</p>

<p>“Yes!” she said slowly. “I am&mdash;begging. I am
begging for time. Give me another year&mdash;give me
this summer, and let me&mdash;try!”</p>

<p>He was studying the girl’s passionate face with a
curious interest. A singular idea had presented itself
to him, and he was considering it half mockingly.
Nevertheless it lent a human sound to his voice as he
answered her.</p>

<p>“See here, Miss Preston,” he said. “I admire
your pluck and energy. But let me tell you that you
don’t want to hold on to that farm. The orchards
are too old to be productive; the land needs
fertilizers, rotation, all sorts of things that require
brains and money. That old fool, Morrison, hasn’t
managed the place properly, and can’t. It’s a losing
fight, and you’d better give it up&mdash;peaceably.”</p>

<p>“But I want it,” she urged, “for Jimmy. I want
to hold the place for him. He’ll soon grow up now,
and&mdash;he’s the last of the Prestons.”</p>

<p>She stopped short and sprang to her feet, with a
little gasp of angry protest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are laughing at me!” she cried indignantly.
“You have no right&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She was mistaken; Stephen Jarvis seldom indulged
in laughter; but his hard-set mouth had relaxed
somewhat under his clipped mustache. His greenish
brown eyes shone with an unaccustomed light. He
was thinking his own thoughts, and for once, at least,
he found a singular pleasure in them.</p>

<p>“Don’t get excited,” he advised her coolly. “Sit
down and we’ll talk this over. You want to keep the
farm for that half-brother of yours, you say. Well,
I’m disposed to give it to you to do as you like with, if
you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She gazed at him almost incredulously.</p>

<p>“You’ll give me time to try?” she asked breathlessly.
“Oh, thank you!”</p>

<p>He answered her impetuous question with another.
“Did you notice the person who showed you in?
Yes; I see you did, particularly. Well, she’s my
housekeeper. She’s been here since my&mdash;since I buried
the late Mrs. Jarvis. But I&mdash;well; I’m tired of seeing
the woman about. I shall need somebody to take
her place, and&mdash;Stop! I want you to hear me
out.”</p>

<p>The girl had not resumed her seat at Jarvis’s bidding.
She retreated swiftly toward the door. The
man’s imperious voice followed her.</p>

<p>“Come back! I’m not done with what I had to
say!”</p>

<p>But Barbara had already closed the door definitely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
behind her. The woman in black silk stood just outside.
She had, in fact, been listening.</p>

<p>“Well!” she breathed explosively, staring at Barbara.
Then she rustled toward the front door, her
ample draperies filling the narrow twilight passage
with a harsh, swishing sound.</p>

<p>“You better not show your face here again!” she
said in a low, fierce voice, as she held the door wide
for Barbara to pass out.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">IV</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">Jimmy Preston</span> sat curled up on one foot by the
table in Peg Morrison’s loft. His yellow hair was
damp and towsled, for he had run bare-headed
through the rain, bearing his precious book of “Vallable
Information” tucked under his blouse.</p>

<p>“I didn’t bring my red ink,” he explained breathlessly
to Peg, “‘cause I was ’fraid I’d spill it. I
fought I could borrow some of yours.”</p>

<p>“You can, an’ welcome, son,” agreed Peg, “but
remember that’ll give me an option on yours. Them
that borrows ought to be willin’ to lend. They ain’t
though, as a gen’ral thing. Borrowers is spenders,
and lenders is savers, as a rule.”</p>

<p>“I’ll lend you my whole bottle of red ink an’ I’ll
lend you my pen, too,” said Jimmy magnificently.</p>

<p>The little boy spread his book open on the table
for Mr. Morrison’s inspection. “You see I’ve begun
it already,” he said with pride.</p>

<p>“Le’ me see; what you got here?” and Peg traced
the first wavering line with a horny forefinger.</p>

<p>“That’s how not to lose a letter,” said Jimmy
proudly. “Barb’ra says sometimes letters are ’portant,
an’ you don’t want to lose ’em.”</p>

<p>“‘Lev letters in the posoffis. They wil be saf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
ther,’” read Peg slowly. He paused and screwed his
mouth in a noiseless whistle.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think that’s a vallable inf’mation?”
demanded Jimmy anxiously. “If I hadn’t taken
that letter and put it in my pocket, I shouldn’t have
lost it. Barb’ra could have got it herself, and maybe
it was ’portant. You can’t tell ’thout you read a
letter whether it’s ’portant or not; an’ you can’t
read a letter when it’s lost.”</p>

<p>“So you lost a letter ’dressed to Barb’ry, did you?
H’m! Where’d you lose it?”</p>

<p>“If I knew, I’d go an’ find it,” said Jimmy soberly.
“I put it in my pocket, an’ it was blue, an’ it was
f’om out west. Barb’ra doesn’t know who it was
f’om. But she’d like to know.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” repeated Peg. “You’d ought to carried
it all the way right in your han’, where you c’d
see it. Pockets are kind o’ dangerous when it comes
to letters. I know a whole row o’ little boys ’at ain’t
alive at all, ’count o’ a letter bein’ lost. They never
was born,” he added by way of explanation.</p>

<p>Jimmy drew a deep sigh of sustained interest.</p>

<p>“You see it was this way,” continued Peg circumstantially.
“The’ was a young feller ’at I used
to know, an’ he was workin’ in a lumber-camp one
winter where the’ wasn’t any pos’offis; one o’ the men
used to carry the letters in an’ out, a matter o’ fifteen
miles. One time he lost a letter this young feller
wrote to his girl, an’ didn’t think to say nothin’
’bout it; an’ she got all worked up ’cause she didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
hear f’om him, an’ after a spell she up an’ married
another man; an’ so the young man I was speakin’ of
never got married, an’ never had any little boys o’ his
own. He felt awful bad ’bout it fer a long time, but he
ain’t never los’ a letter ’at b’longed to anybody else.”</p>

<p>The pattering sound of the rain on the barn roof
increased to a steady roar as Peg related this short
but instructive tale.</p>

<p>“I sh’d think those little boys would feel bad,”
said Jimmy sympathetically. “I’d hate not to be
alive.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe they do; an’ ag’in, mebbe they don’t,”
observed Peg cautiously. “Anyhow, some of ’em
would be growed up by this time; farmin’ it, mebbe,
or keepin’ store.” His eyes wore a far-away look.</p>

<p>Jimmy dipped Peg’s pen in the red ink bottle.</p>

<p>“How do you spell not, Peg?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“K-n-o-t,” replied the old man, with a sigh.</p>

<p>Jimmy was silent for a long minute, his pen travelling
slowly along the blue line and leaving a trail of
wabbly red letters behind.</p>

<p>“‘Hough knot to los a letter,’” he read aloud,
with honest pride in his achievement. “What’ll I
say next, Peg?”</p>

<p>“Keep yer mind an’ yer eyes onto it till you get it
t’ the person it’s meant for,” the old man said, with
some sternness. “You’ve got to do that with ev’rythin’
you do,” he went on. “You can’t go moseyin’
’long thinkin’ ’bout ev’rythin’ under the sun ’cept
what you’re doin’. If you’re ploughin’, plough, an’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
put all the grit an’ gumption you’ve got onto ploughin’.
Most folks ain’t so smart ’at they c’n afford to
run a d’partment store in their minds. Hold on!
Don’t try to write all that. Jus’ say, pay attention
to that letter. You know, Cap’n,” he went on impressively,
“you come of awful fine stock. The
Prestons was always smart; your great-gran’father,
he was smarter ’an all possess, an’ your gran’father,
he was jes’ the same.”</p>

<p>“An’ my father was, too,” interrupted Jimmy,
eying the old man with a pucker between his brown
eyes. “Wasn’t he smarter’n all possess, Peg?”</p>

<p>“‘Course he was, Cap’n,” agreed the old man
hastily. “Up to the time he was took sick, he was
A number one. An’ Barb’ry&mdash;I mean Miss Barb’ry,
she’s awful smart an’ ambitious, too, fer a female.
Oh, you’ll get along in the world, Cap’n, ’course
you’ll get along! But losin’ letters is like losin’ other
things, such as money an’&mdash;an’ health, an’ reputation
an’&mdash;farms. It all comes o’ lettin’ yer mind kind
o’ wander. You won’t do that, will you, Cap’n?”</p>

<p>The man’s voice trembled; he seemed anxiously intent
on the little boy’s answer.</p>

<p>“I won’t, if I can help it, Peg,” Jimmy answered
honestly. “But,” he added candidly, “I like to
think ’bout things in school&mdash;all kind o’ things.
When I look out the windows an’ see the trees wavin’
an’ hear the birds I like t’ p’tend I’m outdoors
playin’.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you do it, Cap’n,” Peg spoke almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
solemnly. “You keep a stiddy holt on them thoughts
o’ yourn’ an’ nail ’em down to readin’, writin’, an’
’rithmetic. If you ketch ’em a-wanderin’ out the window,
you fetch ’em back an’ make ’em work. You
c’n do it, every trip.”</p>

<p>“But if I don’t want to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There you got it! Struck the nail square on
the head, Cap’n. You’ve got to make yourself want
to. You ain’t too young to learn, neither. Gracious!
I wisht somebody’d told me what I’m tellin’ you,
when I was ’bout your age. I’ve kind o’ reasoned
it out, watchin’ folks an’ their doin’s, an’ noticin’ how
I try an’ squirm out o’ doin’ things. The’s two
folks in ev’rybody, Cap’n; a lazy, good-fer-nothin’
sort o’ a chap, that won’t do nothin’ in school, nor
anywheres else if he c’n help it, an’ there’s a smart,
good, up-an’-a-goin’ feller ’at’s anxious to git along
in the world. I know ’em both inside o’ me. An’
ol’ lazybones come nigh onto ruinin’ me when I was a
boy. Lord! I jes’ wouldn’ work! Ust t’ lie half th’
day in the sun an’ think o’ nothin’, when I’d ought t’
been hoein’ corn. Then I’d come in an’&mdash;say I had
the backache, or th’ headache or&mdash;mos’ anythin’ I
could think of. Ol’ lazybones is an awful liar, Cap’n.
You don’t want t’ listen to anythin’ he says. You
want to shet him up an’ keep him shet. He’ll lead
a man t’ drink an’ to steal other folks’ time an’
money; he’s meaner’n pusley an’ slyer’n&mdash;well, he’s
s’ durned sly, Cap’n, that you gotta be on his track
all the endurin’ while.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you think I’ve got two folks in me, Peg?”
asked Jimmy, laying his hand over the pit of his
stomach with a worried look.</p>

<p>“I’m reelly ’fraid ye have, Cap’n,” said Peg firmly.
“I never see anybody ’at hadn’t. But ef you git
th’ upper han’ o’ ol’ lazybones now’t you’re small,
you won’t have much trouble with him.”</p>

<p>“I’m not small, Peg,” Jimmy corrected him.
“You said I was large an’&mdash;an’ hefty fer my
age.”</p>

<p>“Sure you be, Cap’n, but you ain’t reelly a man
growed. That’s what I mean, an’ I want you should
grow up into an A number one man, full o’ grit an’
gumption. An’ you can’t do it unless you start right.
You see, Cap’n, I’m gittin’ ’long in life an’ I’ve figgered
it out ’at ’bout six folks out o’ every ten kind
o’ see-saws back an’ forth betwixt bein’ lazy an’
lyin’ an’ no ’count, an’ bein’ industrious an’ truthful.
Folks like that gits ’long so-so; they don’t hev no
partickler good luck&mdash;ol’ lazybones keeps ’em f’om
that; but they don’t git nowheres neither, ’cause they
don’t stick to biz. Then the’s ’bout three out o’ ev’y
ten thet gives right up to ol’ lazybones f’om the start;
an’ he runs ’em right into th’ ground ’s fas’ ’s possible.
The tenth man, he stomps on ol’ lazybones
ev’ry time he opens his head t’ speak, an’ bimeby he
gits on the right track s’ stiddy an’ constant ’at nobody
c’n stop ’im. An’ he’s the one thet gits thar!
I want you should be that kind o’ a man, Cap’n.
An’ that’s one reason I give you that book o’ Vallable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Info’mation. It’ll help you to kind o’ think over differ’nt
things that happens. Now I’ll bet you won’t
lose another letter in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t,” Jimmy said earnestly. “An’ I’m
goin’ to try an’ stomp on ol’ lazybones.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Cap’n,” cried Peg. “You jes’
stomp on him hard an’ proper. You git th’ upper
han’ o’ him b’fore he grows too big and hefty, an’
bimeby he won’t bother you.”</p>

<p>“Peg,” said Jimmy, after a period devoted to reflection,
“the Hon’rable Stephen Jarvis is in our
house.”</p>

<p>“Dear me! You don’t say so!” ejaculated Peg,
with a frightened start.</p>

<p>“He makes Barb’ra cry,” said Jimmy, scowling
fiercely. “I wanted to stay an’ keep him f’om doin’
it; but Barb’ra said for me to come out here and see
you. I’d like to stomp on him&mdash;hard!”</p>

<p>The subject of these dubious comments and conjectures,
more ill at ease than his worst enemy had
ever hoped to see him, sat in the dull light of the
rainy afternoon, looking at Barbara Preston with
new eyes: to wit, the eyes of a man.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” the girl said steadily, “you have
come to tell me that you will foreclose the mortgage.”
She gripped her hands close in her lap.</p>

<p>“No,” said Stephen Jarvis, “that was not my
intention. As I have already informed you, the
mortgage will foreclose itself, when the time
comes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>He stopped short and narrowed his lids frowningly.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking about you,” he said harshly,
“since you left me so abruptly yesterday. Why
did you do it? And yet, I am glad, on the whole, that
you did. I want to tell you that I stood in my library
door and witnessed my housekeeper’s dismissal of
you from my house. Her own followed without
delay.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” Barbara told him mechanically.
She was noticing dazedly that Jarvis was dressed as
she had occasionally seen him in church, and that
his gloves and linen were quite fresh and immaculate.</p>

<p>“Why should you be sorry?” he demanded with
a straight look at her.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;why, I think I should be sorry for any woman
who had lost what she wanted to keep,” Barbara
answered. “If you discharged her because
I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You were not primarily the cause of her
dismissal,” he said coolly. “I had already
told you that I was tired of seeing the woman
about.”</p>

<p>He was silent for a long time, gazing frowningly
at the floor.</p>

<p>Suddenly he looked up and, meeting Barbara’s
astonished and somewhat indignant eyes, held them
steadily with his own.</p>

<p>“You are wondering why I came here to-day.
You are afraid of me, and you doubtless fancy with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the rest of the world that you&mdash;dislike me exceedingly.”</p>

<p>Barbara opened her lips to reply.</p>

<p>“Don’t take the trouble to deny it,” he went on,
with a faint sneer. “I know what most people think
of me, perhaps with reason. But I am myself, not
another; and so far, fear&mdash;dislike have seemed to me
unavoidable.” Again his rigid lips relaxed into
something like a smile, and he looked questioningly at
the girl.</p>

<p>“It ought to be easy,” she said uncertainly, “to
make people like you. You might&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know what you are thinking of,” he interrupted
rudely. “But it wouldn’t do. People fear
and hate a hard man; they despise a fool. I refuse
to be despised.”</p>

<p>He rose and walked up and down the room impatiently
as if his thoughts irked him. Finally he
paused before the window where a scarlet geranium
blossomed on the sill, and turned a singularly flushed
face upon the girl. For a dazed instant she wondered
with a thrill of painfully remembered fear if he
had been drinking.</p>

<p>“You will be startled at what I am about to say
to you,” he said, in a changed voice. “I should
have laughed at the idea if anyone had suggested it to
me a week ago. But&mdash;I want you to marry me. I
want you to be my wife. No! don’t answer; don’t
refuse! You haven’t thought what it means. You
cannot consider the matter so suddenly. But this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
much you can understand, I will give you this place
on our wedding-day&mdash;to do with as you like, and I
will attach no conditions to the gift.”</p>

<p>Barbara had not removed her fascinated gaze
from his face. She felt like one dreaming fantastically
and struggling unavailingly to awake.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you do not realize what you have asked
of me,” she said at last. “But&mdash;I will not sell myself
for this farm. That is what you have asked me
to do.”</p>

<p>Her eyes sparkled blue fire; her lips curled disdainfully.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool,” he said roughly. “I want
nothing of the sort. I want you&mdash;you! I need you.
I am more sure of it now than ever.”</p>

<p>He took three steps toward her, his rugged face
alive with determination&mdash;the grim determination
which had wrested all that he possessed from the grip
of a hostile world.</p>

<p>“When I want anything,” he said doggedly, “I
always get it. Didn’t you know that? I want you.”</p>

<p>“You’ll not get me&mdash;ever!” cried Barbara.</p>

<p>She knew it must be war to the bitter end between
them, and she flung the gage of battle full in his face
with fine recklessness.</p>

<p>“You may take everything I have, if you can.
But you’ll not get me!”</p>

<p>He stood up and buttoned his frock coat over his
white waistcoat.</p>

<p>“I’ll not take your answer to-day,” he said, quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
unmoved by her anger. “I had no intention of
doing so.”</p>

<p>He strode to the door without another look at
her, signalled his coachman, stepped into his closed
carriage, shut the door hard behind him and rolled
away, with a smooth whir of shining wheels.</p>

<h2 class="p4">V</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">“I’ll</span> give her time to think before I see her again,”
Jarvis decided, as his swift-stepping bays carried him
along through the April rain. He dropped the window
of his brougham and drew in deep satisfying
breaths of the moist air. He was glad that she had
not yielded supinely, as a weaker woman might have
done. There was to his mind something heroic,
splendid in her attitude as she defied him. For the
first time in his life, Stephen Jarvis felt the stir of
half-awakened passion; and the savage within his
breast, never wholly eliminated or even tamed by an
imperfect civilization, exulted at the thought of the
imminent conflict of wills, the flight, the pursuit, the
inevitable capture.</p>

<p>“I’ll give her time to think&mdash;to be afraid!” he repeated;
“then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The blood hammered in his temples and involuntarily
he clenched his strong hands, as if already
crushing that weaker woman’s will and subduing it to
his own.</p>

<p>But Barbara Preston was not thinking of the fact
that Stephen Jarvis had asked her to be his wife.
Being a woman, and, moreover, hard driven by cruel
necessity, she might have been pardoned, if for a
moment she had allowed her thoughts to linger upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the interview which had just ended. She might even
have recalled with a certain speculative interest the
luxurious interior of the carriage into which he had
stepped and the smooth roll of the wheels which had
borne him away, safe shut from the wind and the
weather. So might she be lifted and sheltered from
the bleak peltings of poverty, and life become a
smooth progression instead of a painful pilgrimage.
The girl sat quite still by the window looking out
through misty panes into a mistier world, and only
vaguely aware of dripping lilac sprays, ruddy with
swelling buds, and of the flash of wet brown wings
athwart the gray sky.</p>

<p>Stephen Jarvis, master of fate, and thrilling with
the clash of his will upon hers, could hardly have
known that the ghost of another man stood between
him and the object of this new, urgent desire of his.
He would have laughed the shadowy presence to scorn
had he known it.</p>

<p>Yet it was this mere shadow of a man which
chained Barbara’s thoughts while the April rain
softened the landscape to a soft green blur. After
all it was but natural that her one pitiful little love
story should come back to her now, even to a vision of
David Whitcomb’s eager face, his dark impatient
eyes, and tossed hair, and the strong clasp of his
hand upon hers in the dusk of the summer twilight.</p>

<p>It was Jimmy who had come between them; little
motherless Jimmy, then a baby a year old, with big
appealing eyes under a fluff of soft yellow hair, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
a voice sweeter than any bird’s. All the woman’s
heart in her had gone out to the helpless little creature
who nestled in her arms at night, and whose eyes and
voice followed her as she went about her work by
day. This in the days when her father, grown suddenly
old and apathetic, had begun to shut himself
up in his library, for what purpose Barbara did not
guess, at first. When she did know it was too late.
The leaves of the book had been long closed and
sealed, but the heart within her shivered at the remembrance
of what was written there.</p>

<p>“If you really loved me,” David had said hotly,
“you would not let anyone or anything come between
us.”</p>

<p>She told him that she could not go to him over the
bodies of a sick father and a helpless child. And since
he had asked this of her, she did not, indeed, love him.</p>

<p>After this stormy scene&mdash;the last between them,
since David Whitcomb had gone away, no one knew
whither, nor indeed cared, since he was young and
friendless and poor&mdash;Barbara had cried herself to
sleep for many successive nights, quietly, so as not
to disturb the sleeping child. But one does not weep
overlong at night whose brain and hands and feet
are employed in the daytime. Only the beggared
rich may give themselves to the indolent luxury of
grief. After many nights of weeping followed by
days of anxiety and uncounted labors, the pain of
that parting subsided to a dull aching memory, which
wakened once to cry out bitterly when she heard that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
he had been seen on a ship bound to the Yukon
region in the early days of the gold fever. Many
perished along the trail that year. It was rumored
that David Whitcomb was among the number. No
word ever came back to contradict the rumor, which
after the lapse of months was accepted as a fact, and
so&mdash;forgotten.</p>

<p>It was a long time&mdash;as youth measures time&mdash;since
she had thought of David Whitcomb. Now
she deliberately travelled back over the years between,
and stood looking at her anguished young
self, torn between love and duty, and at her one lover,
who was not noble enough&mdash;she saw this with mournful
certainty now&mdash;to help her lift and carry her
heavy burden. Nevertheless she forgave him&mdash;as
she had done hundreds of times in the past, excusing
him tenderly, as a mother might have done, for his
hot young selfishness, which refused to share her
heart with a dying man and a helpless little child.</p>

<p>“I am glad,” she said aloud to the shadowy presence
of her one lover, “glad that I did not yield.”</p>

<p>But her face was grave and sorrowful as she rose
to answer a gentle knock at the kitchen door.</p>

<p>Peg Morrison stood there under the shelter of an
ancient green umbrella, his puckered face smiling
and healthily pink against the pale green of the outside
world.</p>

<p>“I lef’ the Cap’n a-studyin’ over his book,” he
chuckled, as he stepped into the kitchen, carefully
wiping his feet on the braided rug inside. “He takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
to vallable info’mation as the sparks fly upwards, an’
I’m glad to see it. Thinks I, as I looked at him
settin’ down improvin’ maxims in red ink, this is a
good time to talk over the situation with Miss Barb’ry.”</p>

<p>Barbara drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>“Come in,” she said briefly.</p>

<p>Then, as Peg seated himself in a wooden chair,
ceremoniously arranging his coat-tails on either side,
she added, “There isn’t much to say.”</p>

<p>“Wall, I’ve been thinkin’ fer quite a spell back
that mebbe you’d like t’ lease th’ farm to me, ’stid o’
my workin’ it on shares, as heretofore. I’m&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t had any share, Peg,” Barbara
said, with a shade of impatience. “And that is why I
have felt so&mdash;so unwilling to have you stay here and
work, when I couldn’t possibly pay you what I knew
you were earning.”</p>

<p>Peg struck one heavy palm upon his knee before
he answered, his kindly face drawn into myriad
comical puckers.</p>

<p>“Now, look-a-here, Miss Barb’ry,” he began.
“You an’ me’s argued this ’ere question over more’n
once. If I don’t get my share I’d like to know
who does? I git m’ livin’, don’t I? An’ I git free
house-rent, don’t I? An’ them two items, livin’ an’
house-rent, ’s ’bout all mos’ folks git. W’y, Miss
Barb’ry, I live luxurious to what lots o’ folks do.
And then ag’in you mus’ remember that I ain’t a
reelly d’sirable farm laborer. I’m gittin’ ’long in life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
an’ I can’t put in the kind and description o’ a day’s
work folks’ll pay good wages fer. I’ll bet you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>And the old man raised his voice to the argumentative
pitch commonly employed in heated controversies
around the stove in Hewett’s grocery.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you a dollar an’ a half ’at I couldn’t git
a place on a farm ’round here to save my neck! I’ll
bet I’d git turned down quicker’n scat ev’ry place I’d
try. ‘What!’ they’d say, ’ol’ Peg Morrison wants a
place? That ol’ coot? Why, he ain’t wo’th his
victuals!’ ’Tain’t reelly fur f’om charity, Miss Barb’ry,
fer you to keep me here, givin’ me all the veg’tables
an’ po’k I want, with now an’ then a fresh egg,
er a&mdash;chicken. Sakes alive! I tell ye I’m grateful
of a winter night when I creep under that nice patchwork
quilt you give me ’at I’m workin’ fer a lady&mdash;on
shares.”</p>

<p>Barbara laughed, an irrepressible girlish laugh,
even while she shook her head.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t pay you for what you’ve done for
Jimmy and me since&mdash;since father died, and&mdash;before,
too. And I can’t thank you, either. I couldn’t find
words to do it if I tried.”</p>

<p>“Thank me!” echoed the old man exuberantly.
“Say, excuse me fer appearin’ to smile, Miss Barb’ry.”
His voice grew suddenly grave. “I guess
ther’ ain’t any pertickler use in quarrellin’ ’bout it,
after all. I’ll do what I can fer you an’ the boy&mdash;bein’
a poor shakes of a laborer&mdash;jes’ ’s long ’s I
live, an’ you c’n d’pend upon it. But now what do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
you think ’bout leasin’ th’ farm&mdash;say, fer a thousand
dollars?”</p>

<p>Peg’s eyes grew round, and he gasped a little at
the magnitude of the proposition.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a dollar or two laid by fer a rainy day,
an’ I’ll put that down in advance,” he went on, with
a chuckle, “an’ the way I’ve figgered it I’ll make
big money on the deal. W’y, look-a-here,” and he
drew a soiled newspaper from his pocket, “I come
’cross this ’ere article th’ other day. I’d like t’
read t’ you what it says on the subjec’ o’ onions.
‘Thirty-three acres o’ land in onions netted John
Closner of Hidalgo, Texas, ’leven thousan’ dollars!’
Hear that, will ye? He says he perduced thirty-six
carloads off’n his farm&mdash;more’n a carload t’ an
acre!’ Hold on! that ain’t all&mdash;’course that’s in
Texas. But listen t’ this, Miss Barb’ry&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But, Peg, there isn’t any use of talking,” interrupted
the girl, “the mortgage is going to be foreclosed
the first of June, unless I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Foreclosed&mdash;eh? Foreclosed!” echoed the old
man. “Wall, I was ’fraid of it when I seen his
buggy here yist’day an’ ag’in t’-day. Farmers
’round here say they hate th’ sight o’ that red-wheeled
buggy worse’n pison snakes. It gene’ally
means business o’ th’ kind they ain’t lookin’ fer.
Say! I wisht I’d got a-holt o’ this ’ere article on
onion-growin’ before. I reelly do. Jes’ listen t’ this:
‘Onions are profitably grown in th’ north, also.
Ebenezer N. Foote of Northampton, Mass., has perduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
av’rage crops ’s high es nine hunderd an’
ten bushels t’ th’ acre! He says he expects to raise
that to twelve hunderd! The annual value of his
crop ranges f’om five hunderd to six hunderd dollars
per acre!’”</p>

<p>Peg’s voice swelled into a veritable pæan in a high
key; his face glowed with the ecstasies of his imaginings.
He carefully folded the newspaper and stuffed
it into a capacious pocket.</p>

<p>“Now, y’ see,” he went on oratorically, “exclusive
o’ the orchards, which had ought to net us
at least five hunderd dollars this year, we could put
in, say, twenty acres o’ onions, at five hunderd dollars
per acre, that would net us&mdash;l’me see, five hunderd
dollars times twenty acres ’ud make. Here,
lemme figger that out.”</p>

<p>The old man fumbled in his vest pocket for a
stubbed pencil.</p>

<p>“I ain’t th’ lightnin’ calculator you’d expect fer
such a schemin’ ol’ cuss,” he murmured apologetically,
as he wet the lead preparatory to computation.</p>

<p>Barbara smiled. “It would be ten thousand dollars,”
she said. “But, Peg, don’t you see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ten thousand dollars! Whew! I guess that
’ud make a mortgage look kind o’ sick, wouldn’t it?
We’d ought to hold on a spell longer an’ give onions
a try.”</p>

<p>“But we can’t, Peg. It’s only six weeks before
the first of June, and I’ve only twenty dollars in the
world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Barbara leaned back in her chair, her face relaxed
and weary and unutterably sad.</p>

<p>“You must look for another place right away,
Peg,” she went on, “I’ll try and find one for you.
Then, if I can get a school, or&mdash;some sort of work.
I don’t care much what it is, if it will keep Jimmy
and me.”</p>

<p>“The’s a whole lot o’ money in p’tatoes, too,”
grumbled Peg, his anxious blue eyes on her face.
“I’d ought to ’ave sowed peas an’ oats on that hill
lot las’ fall an’ ploughed ’em in this spring. It
says in this ’ere article on big crops that’ll grow
p’tatoes like all possessed. I wisht I’d come acrost
th’ inf’mation b’fore.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Jarvis says the farm is worn out,” Barbara
said, a growing despondency in her voice. “He
says the orchards are worthless, too; they are old.”</p>

<p>“Shucks!” exploded Peg. “‘Course Jarvis’d talk
like that when he’s gittin’ it away f’om you fer
nothin’ like its value. I’ll bet he’d have another
story to tell ef anybody was to try ’n buy it of him.
Values has a way o’ risin’ over night like bread
dough once Stephen Jarvis gits a-holt o’ a piece o’
prop’ty.”</p>

<p>“He asked me to marry him,” said Barbara
abruptly. Then bit her lip angrily at the old man’s
look of amazed incredulity. “I’m sure I don’t know
why I told you, only I&mdash;haven’t anyone to speak to,
and&mdash;no one to advise me.”</p>

<p>Peg’s face grew suddenly grave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t you be afraid I’ll mention it, Miss Barb’ry,”
he said gently. “‘Course I was kind o’
s’prised&mdash;at first. But I don’t know’s I be, come t’
think o’ it. He asked you to be Mis’ Jarvis? Wall!
You goin’ to do it, Miss Barb’ry?”</p>

<p>“He said he would give me the farm,” Barbara
went on slowly, “to do as I liked with. I could&mdash;give
it to Jimmy.”</p>

<p>She looked at him with a child’s unconscious
appeal.</p>

<p>“Do you think I ought to&mdash;to marry him,
Peg?”</p>

<p>The old man was still eyeing her soberly, even
wistfully.</p>

<p>“I’ve knowed you sence you was a little girl no
higher’n my knee, Miss Barb’ry,” he began. “I’ve
seed you grow up. An’ I’ve seed you go through
some pretty hard experiences. Now, I ain’t the kind
to talk very much ’bout my religion, an’ the’s times
when I don’t ’pear to have a nawful lot of it; but
the’s a God that hears an’&mdash;an’ takes notice. That
much I’ve found out, an’ ef I was you I’d go to headquarters
an’ git th’ best advice. But I’ll say this,
ef the farm is wore out,&mdash;es he says,&mdash;it ’pears t’ me
he’s askin’ a pretty high price fer th’ prop’ty. He
wants your youth, Miss Barb’ry, an’ your pretty
looks, an’ your life. An’ es fer the Cap’n&mdash;Wall,
I’d ruther not d’pend too much on th’ Hon’rable
Stephen Jarvis, when it comes t’ th’ Cap’n. That’s
the way it looks to me. ’Course I don’t p’tend to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
be a good jedge o’ what’s best in th’ world. I don’t
look like it, do I?”</p>

<p>He glanced down at his patched and faded clothes
with a cheerfully acquiescent smile.</p>

<p>“I’ve a notion,” he went on, “that the Lord’ll
advise ye ’long th’ same lines ’s I hev. But don’t
take my word fer it.”</p>

<p>“None of my prayers have been answered,” Barbara
said, her red lips setting themselves in obstinate
lines. “I’ve given up expecting anything so foolish.
I prayed to have father get well, and he&mdash;died.”</p>

<p>“But he got well,” put in Peg quietly. “You c’n
bet he did. Mebbe the Lord couldn’t fetch it ’round
any other way. The’ was so many things ag’in him.”</p>

<p>Barbara’s delicate brows went up scornfully.</p>

<p>“I don’t call dying getting well,” she said.</p>

<p>“H’m!” murmured the old man gently. “Mebbe
we don’t always call things by their right names.”</p>

<p>He got to his feet slowly.</p>

<p>“Wall, I mus’ be gittin’ out t’ the barn.”</p>

<p>He fixed his friendly, anxious eyes on the girl.</p>

<p>“I guess I’d figger a spell on that marryin’ proposition,
ef I was you,” he said softly, and shook his
head.</p>

<p>He turned, with his hand on the latch, to cast a
dubious look back at the girl.</p>

<p>“It ’pears t’ me you ain’t cut out right for the
second Mis’ Jarvis,” he said. “She’d ought b’ rights
t’ be a big, upstandin’ female, with&mdash;with red hair.”</p>

<p>He shut the door hastily behind him.</p>

<h2 class="p4">VI</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">It</span> is a well-worn, yet none the less true saying that
every human life is a chain of causes and effects; each
effect a cause, and each cause an effect, stretching
back to an unimagined and unimaginable First
Cause; and on and on into endless, undreamed of
vistas of the future. Yet the realization of this
vague, yet tremendous fact comes but seldom even to
the thoughtful mind, so busy are we forging link on
link of the chain which binds us alike to past and
future.</p>

<p>Barbara Preston, stopping aimlessly to read the
notice of an auction of farm stock and household
furniture advertised to take place in a neighboring
township, could not guess that the trivial impulse
that stayed her feet by the big chestnut at the roadside
linked itself with events already slowly shaping
in her future. The notice was printed in bold red
letters on a buff background, calculated to seize and
hold the eye of the passerby, and set forth the fact
that one Thomas Bellows, Auctioneer, would, on the
twenty-fifth day of April, sell to the highest bidder,
on the premises of the owner, four milch cows, three
farm horses, and sixty-four sheep. Also one young
carriage horse, well broken, sound, kind, and willing.
Other items relating to household gear and poultry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
followed, set down in due order of their relative
importance.</p>

<p>The red letters on the buff ground passed into
Barbara’s eyes&mdash;as indeed they were purposefully intended&mdash;and
impressed themselves on her memory.
She considered them half angrily as she pursued her
way to the post-office, picturing to herself the day
when Thomas Bellows or another, would noisily exploit
the contents of her own well-loved home. There
was little there to bring money, and the mortgage
covered stock and furniture as well as the land itself.
She had learned this from a curt letter addressed to
her by Stephen Jarvis in reply to questions of her
own as concisely put.</p>

<p>Apart from her half-dazed recollection of the
rainy afternoon a week since, their relations as ruthless
creditor and hopeless debtor appeared to be
unchanged. During the interval she had gone doggedly
about her self-imposed labors, rising in the
faint light of dawn to set strawberry and lettuce
plants, wintered carefully on the south side of the
big barns, with the vague unreasoning hope that
somehow or other she might be permitted to reap
the fruit of her toil. Between times she was casting
about for another home and other modes of livelihood
for herself and Jimmy. It would be difficult, if not
impossible, she was told, to secure a position to teach.
Only normal-school graduates stood any chance of
preferment, and there appeared to be no prospect of
a vacancy of any kind before fall. To become a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
dressmaker’s apprentice was possible; but the woman
who provided the opportunity offered instruction for
the first six months in lieu of wages. And obviously
one could not live on information alone, however
valuable. Household servants were always in brisk
demand, she had been reminded; but pride of race
wrestled with the untold humiliation of such a lot.
Besides, there was Jimmy. Her heart grew faint at
the thought of the loving, carefully-shielded child in
the cold shelter of an “asylum” or the bound property
of some shrewd farmer, an investment involving a
grudging expenditure of coarse food and scanty, insufficient
clothing and forced to yield an ever-increasing
increment of labor. Oh, life was cruel at its best.
Her flesh and her soul cried out at the thought of
what its worst might be. If there was a way of
escape, why not accept it?</p>

<p>She was turning these things wearily over in her
mind when the quick whir of wheels sounded at her
back. She stepped aside to allow the vehicle to
pass, without raising her eyes.</p>

<p>A harsh, domineering voice, the sort of voice to
be slavishly obeyed, ordered the horse to stand still.</p>

<p>She looked up quickly to meet the eager gaze of
the man who was in her thoughts. A vivid color, of
which she was angrily conscious, rose to her forehead.
She stammered some sort of greeting, her eyes
drooping before the dominant insistence in his.</p>

<p>“I was just on my way to your house,” he said.</p>

<p>His voice, as well as his eyes, was eager, insistent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Get in, won’t you, and ride with me? I have
something to say to you.”</p>

<p>The girl hesitated, her cheeks paling. He sprang
to the ground, speaking sharply to his young, restive
horse.</p>

<p>“Allow me to assist you,” he said, with a politeness
wholly unfamiliar to Barbara.</p>

<p>She gave him an astonished look, which he interpreted
correctly, with the acumen of a trained
politician.</p>

<p>“You have been thinking that I was exceedingly
abrupt&mdash;even rude, in the way I spoke to you the
other day,” he said, as he took her firmly by the hand
and lifted her to a seat in the vehicle which was
“dreaded more’n pison snakes” by the delinquent
debtors in the countryside, according to Peg Morrison.</p>

<p>He bent to look keenly into her face, as he seated
himself at her side. “Isn’t that so,&mdash;Barbara?”</p>

<p>At the sound of her name in that new, strange
voice of his the girl started and almost shivered.
She was beginning to be afraid of herself&mdash;this no
less new and strange self, who was tired of being
poor and hardworked and anxious, and who longed
after comfort and ease and affection of some strong,
compelling sort. She lifted her eyes to his.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking many things,” she murmured,
“since&mdash;since you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He laughed under his breath.</p>

<p>“Yes; and you have been doing some things, too,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
he said. “I heard you were looking for a place to
teach, and&mdash;it didn’t encourage me to suppose that
you were thinking very favorably of what I proposed.
Did you secure a position?”</p>

<p>“N-o, I didn’t,” she acknowledged. She hesitated
visibly, then added, “They told me you were a school
commissioner, and that I must apply to you.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you apply to me?” he wanted to
know. “Didn’t you think I would be a good sort of
person to help you in your desire for independence?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t ask you,” she said, “because&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well?” he questioned sharply. “You didn’t
ask me for help because&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How could I?” she demanded, with a spirited
lift of her head. “I asked you for help before and
you refused.”</p>

<p>He looked at her with piercing keenness.</p>

<p>“Did I?” he said gravely. “Well, I offered you&mdash;a
position. You haven’t forgotten, have you?”</p>

<p>Barbara’s heart beat suffocatingly fast. His eyes
were on her face, compelling her, mastering her.</p>

<p>“Would you&mdash;Could I take care of Jimmy just
the same?” she asked, in a muffled voice.</p>

<p>He gave his horse a sharp cut with the whip before
he answered.</p>

<p>“I can’t see why you should bring the boy into
our affairs,” he said coldly. “But he can live with
us&mdash;for the present, if you like. Then there is the
Preston farm; as I’ve already told you, you may do
as you like with it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Barbara looked mistily away over the fields past
which they were driving, the sound of meadow-larks,
calling and answering, and the soft jubilant gurgle
of a bluebird on a nearer fence-rail reaching her like
vaguely reproachful voices out of a dead past. Then
as now had the meadow-larks called “Sweet! oh, my
sweet!”&mdash;in the one spring-time when David Whitcomb
loved her.</p>

<p>“I shall have to&mdash;to think,” she murmured. “I
am afraid&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of what?” he demanded. “Of me?”</p>

<p>She did not answer, and again he cut the horse
impatiently with his keen whip-lash, holding the
spirited creature with a strong grasp on the reins
as he did so.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, after a long silence, “I’m afraid
I can’t make myself over, even for you. But I’ll tell
you something, my girl, there are worse men in the
world than Stephen Jarvis, and perhaps you’ll fall in
with some of ’em, if you turn me down. Look at me,
will you?”</p>

<p>Unwillingly she turned her face to his.</p>

<p>“I shall not take a silly <i>no</i> for an answer,” he
said under his breath. “I never have, and I shan’t
begin with you. I need you, and you need me.”</p>

<p>His eyes held her powerfully.</p>

<p>“Do you love another man?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Barbara faintly. She could not bring
herself to uncover her one dead love before those
pitiless eyes, while the meadow-larks were calling and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
answering with such piercing sweetness. David
Whitcomb was dead. If she had ever loved him it
was as another self in a dim past, growing ever
dimmer.</p>

<p>“Then,” said the Honorable Stephen Jarvis
quietly, “you will marry me.” He broke into a short
laugh. “Do you know I couldn’t bear to think of
your loving another man? Is that being in love?
Tell me, Barbara.”</p>

<p>He laughed again softly, as he bent to peer into
her averted face. She felt herself yielding, her weak
hold on past and future loosening.</p>

<p>She did not answer, but her red mouth quivered.</p>

<p>He experienced a sudden thrilling desire to touch
the fresh innocent lips with his.</p>

<p>“It would be curious,” he murmured unsteadily,
“if I should learn what love is for the first time.
Shall I tell you how old I am, Barbara?”</p>

<p>She looked up at him without curiosity.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m thirty-seven; and I’ve never loved any
woman&mdash;I have never loved anything, except money
and success. But now&mdash;Barbara!”</p>

<p>He bent toward her, his cold eyes alive with passion.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no!” she cried, shrinking from him in sudden
terror.</p>

<p>His face stiffened into its accustomed mask.</p>

<p>“You’re thinking I’ve waited too long,” he said
bitterly, and the curling lash stung the bay horse in
the flank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Neither spoke again while the wheels spun dizzily
along over the mile of road which brought them to
the big stone gate-posts of the Preston farm.</p>

<p>He drew up his foaming horse sharply.</p>

<p>“I won’t come in,” he said, “if you’ll get out
here.”</p>

<p>She felt herself vaguely humiliated as she stepped
down from the high vehicle without assistance.</p>

<p>“Stop!” he ordered as she passed quickly inside,
as if in haste to gain shelter.</p>

<p>She looked up at him uncertainly, her eyes wide
with an emotion akin to terror.</p>

<p>“I shall not humiliate myself by coaxing or cajoling
you,” he said haughtily. “You are best left
alone for the present.”</p>

<p>He lifted his hat with a sweeping bow, and the
red-wheeled buggy dashed away.</p>

<p>Barbara drew a long, struggling sigh. She felt
curiously light and free, as if she had made a breathless
escape from some grasping hand, outstretched to
seize her.</p>

<p>The sight of Jimmy running swiftly down the
driveway toward her heightened the sensation to almost
passionate relief.</p>

<p>“Hello, Barb’ra!” shouted the little boy. “I
came home from school, an’ you wasn’t here. An’
you can’t guess what I’ve got for you!”</p>

<p>The child’s face, glowing rosily with health and
mischief, was uplifted to hers. She stooped and
kissed it tenderly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“What have you got for me, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“Guess!”</p>

<p>“I can’t guess,” she answered soberly. “You’ll
have to tell me.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t cross wiv me, are you, Barb’ra?”</p>

<p>“No, dear, of course I’m not. Why should I be
cross? Why, it&mdash;it’s a letter! Where did you get
it, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“It’s the one I lost,” said the child, puckering up
his chin disappointedly. “I fought you’d be glad.
Peg found it. He said he ’membered the wind was
blowin’ that day; so he looked all along the road on
bof sides, an’ he found it right under a bush.”</p>

<p>Barbara hastily tore the sodden envelope apart.
Her fingers trembled as she unfolded the large stained
sheet.</p>

<p>“Is it all spoiled?” asked Jimmy anxiously.
“Can’t you read it?”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">VII</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">Barbara</span> stared at the stained and defaced sheet
with wide, frightened eyes. Her hands trembled.</p>

<p>“Can’t you read it, Barb’ra?” pleaded Jimmy
anxiously, standing on tip-toe to peep at the letter.
“Peg said he was ’fraid you couldn’t; but he said
maybe you’d know who it was from, an’ if it was
’portant.”</p>

<p>Barbara did not answer. The rain-soaked paper
in her trembling fingers faced her like a mute accusing
ghost out of the past. The lines of writing folded
close upon each other and soaked with rain and the
stain of the wet brown earth had been completely
obliterated; but two words of the many had escaped;
her own name at the beginning of the letter, and
another at its close.</p>

<p>“He is not dead!” she murmured. “He is not
dead!”</p>

<p>Jimmy clutched her sleeve, dancing up and down
in his impatience.</p>

<p>“Is it ’portant, Barb’ra&mdash;is it? Can you read
it?” he persisted.</p>

<p>She faced the child, her eyes clouded with despair
and anger.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t read it!” she cried. “Oh! if you had
only brought it to me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>She turned swiftly and hurried toward the house,
leaving the child lagging forlornly in the rear, his
blue eyes brimmed with tears.</p>

<p>Peg Morrison, digging a patch of garden in the
rear of the house, his battered straw hat drawn low
over his eyes, his teeth firmly closed on a twig of
apple-tree wood, became presently aware of a small
dejected figure lurking in the shadow of the blossoming
tree.</p>

<p>“Hello, Cap’n!” he called out cheerfully, relinquishing
the twig in favor of a spent dandelion stalk.
“Did ye find Barb’ry&mdash;heh? An’ did ye give her the
letter?”</p>

<p>“I gave it to her; but she&mdash;can’t read it. An’&mdash;’n’
I’m ’fraid it was ’portant. She’s mad wiv me,
Barb’ra is; ’n’ I haven’t had any dinner, either.”</p>

<p>The child manfully swallowed the sob that rose in
his throat. Then he selected a tall dandelion with a
plumy top which he put in his mouth in imitation of
Peg, who watched him with a dubious smile.</p>

<p>“Wall, now, that’s too bad, Cap’n,” sympathized
the old man. “But ef Barb’ry can’t read the letter
it mus’ be ’cause ’tain’t best she should. Things
don’t happen b’ chance, Cap’n. You want t’ remember
that. There’s Somebody a-lookin’ out fer things
as don’t make no mistakes.”</p>

<p>Jimmy pondered this dark saying while the dandelion
stem slowly uncurled itself into a dangling spiral.</p>

<p>“Then it was all right for me to lose that letter,
‘N’ you said&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Peg frowned thoughtfully at the antics of a pair
of barn-swallows swooping in and out from under the
eaves.</p>

<p>“No; it wa’n’t right fer you to be careless an’ lose
the letter, Cap’n,” he said decidedly. “But the
Lord&mdash;wall, you see, the Lord is consid’able smarter’n
what we be, an’ He c’n fix things up that go wrong.
Kind o’ arranges it so’t the universe won’t fly the
track, no matter what we do. We ain’t p’mitted t’
disturb the gen’ral peace t’ any great extent. You’ll
understan’ these things better when you’re growed
up, Cap’n.”</p>

<p>“Will I?” said Jimmy hopefully.</p>

<p>Peg thrust his spade into the ground.</p>

<p>“Guess I’d better walk over t’ the house with you,
an’ see if the’s anythin’ I c’n do,” he said briefly.</p>

<p>Barbara was setting the table with quick darting
movements of her lithe figure when the two came
in range of the kitchen door. She paused abruptly
at sight of them.</p>

<p>“You must come in and eat your dinner quick,
Jimmy,” she called, “or you’ll be late to school.”</p>

<p>“You g’wan in, Cap’n,” Peg urged in a diplomatic
whisper. “I guess she’s pretty nigh all right. But
I wouldn’t pester her none ’bout that letter ef I was
you. Mebbe she’d ruther not talk ’bout it yet.”</p>

<p>The child stole into the kitchen with hanging head
and sat down at the table spread for two. He was
very much ashamed of himself in the stormy light of
Barbara’s gray eyes; but Mr. Morrison’s remarks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
concerning the Maker of the universe appeared
worthy of passing on. He fortified himself with a
large slice of brown bread and butter, thickly overlaid
with apple-sauce.</p>

<p>“It couldn’t have been <i>very</i> ’portant, Barb’ra,”
he said blandly.</p>

<p>The girl faced about in the act of taking two
boiled potatoes out of a saucepan.</p>

<p>“But it was, Jimmy. I know that much, and I
can’t read it.”</p>

<p>“Peg says there’s Somebody a-lookin’ out for
things, an’ He made that letter fall out o’ my
pocket.”</p>

<p>“Peg,” interrupted Barbara wrathfully, “knows
nothing about it.”</p>

<p>“‘N’ He let it rain, too,” pursued Jimmy determinedly.
“‘N’ He let the ink run, ’n’ the mud get
on it. Do you want me to tell you who it was? Do
you, Barb’ra?”</p>

<p>“Well, who do you suppose it was?”</p>

<p>“God!” exploded the child dramatically. “Peg
said&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to hear what Peg said. He doesn’t
know.”</p>

<p>“I shall put it,” said the child, “in red ink, in my
Vallable Inf’mation book. It’s a vallable inf’mation.”</p>

<p>“It would be, if it was true.”</p>

<p>“An’ if it isn’t true, it’s a vallable inf’mation. I’ll
put it down that way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“I would,” advised Barbara gloomily. Then she
repented herself and stooped to kiss the child’s quivering
lips. “Anyway,” she said, “I love you; and you
didn’t mean to lose the letter.”</p>

<p>After Jimmy’s inquisitive blue eyes were tight shut
that night, Barbara examined the blurred sheet once
more, holding it between her eyes and the bright light
of the lamp. A word here and there appeared to
emerge from the chaos, where the sharp penpoint
had bitten the paper.</p>

<p>“... never forgotten,” was tolerably distinct.
Then followed a hopeless blur of brown earth stains
and purple ink. But further down the page she
read,</p>

<p>“Write&mdash;if you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>That was all, except his name, “David Whitcomb,”
at the foot of the page.</p>

<p>The postmark had resisted the spoiling of both
rain and mould, and read distinctly, as Al Hewett
had declared, “Tombstone, Arizona,” in a blurred
circle, with the date “April 2” and the hour of
stamping “2-<span class="smcap">P.M.</span>”</p>

<p>With a sudden glad impulse Barbara pulled a sheet
of paper toward her.</p>

<p>“Dear David [she wrote], Your letter has just
reached me, but I can only read a part of it, because&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She paused and hesitated; then went on firmly:</p>

<p>“Jimmy lost it, and it lay out under a bush in the
rain for more than a week. I can make out only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
few words here and there, but those few tell me that
you have not forgotten, and that you want me to
write to you.”</p>

<p>The girl paused to draw a deep, wondering breath.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you how strange it seems to be writing
to you, because I have been thinking of you, David,
for nearly three years as dead. They said you were
lost on a trail in Alaska. And I thought it must be
true. But your letter&mdash;even though I can’t read it&mdash;has
brought me the assurance that you are not in
some far-away heaven, where I have tried to picture
you, David, but on earth.</p>

<p>“This letter may never reach you, for I can only
be sure that your letter to me was mailed in Tombstone;
but I want to tell you that only Jimmy and I
are left. Father died a year ago, and since then I
have been trying to hold the farm for Jimmy. We
are the last of the Prestons, you know, and I do
want&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She stopped short, laid down her pen and listened
breathlessly. She fancied she had heard the
child’s voice calling her from the room above. She
glided noiselessly to the foot of the stair, and listened,
her slight figure seeming to melt, spirit-like, into the
shadows. It was very lonely in the old house. The
tall clock on the stair-landing ticked loud and solemnly
in the stillness, and the wind in the budding
trees without swept past the house with a long sighing
breath. The girl shivered as she listened, then
she went quickly back to the sitting-room with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
cheerful circle of light and its drawn curtains, and
paused to read the words she had written to David
Whitcomb. They sounded stiff and trite after her
brief absence in the shadowy hall. After all, was she
not taking too much for granted? Perhaps he was
merely asking for information, which he felt sure he
could obtain from her on the score of old friendship.
He had left some books in the bare little room he had
occupied in the village for a year. The minister had
them, she had been told. Her cheeks crimsoned
slowly as she crumpled the half-written page and
tossed it into the waste basket.</p>

<p>Then she chose a fresh sheet and wrote slowly, with
frequent pauses: “Dear David: I was very much surprised
to receive a letter from you after all these
years. I must explain that though I received your
letter to-day I have not been able to read it. It had
been quite spoiled with rain and mildew. If this
reaches you&mdash;and I cannot be sure of it, because I
have only the postmark to go by&mdash;please write to
me again, and I will answer at once.”</p>

<p>She signed the letter quite formally and simply
with her full name, Barbara Allen Preston.</p>

<p>She mailed the letter the next morning, passing
the great Jarvis mansion on her way to the post-office
with averted looks. On the sixteenth morning
thereafter she received back her letter written to
David Whitcomb, with the words printed across the
envelope, “Not called for.” She scarcely knew how
much she had been expecting from David till her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
unopened letter reached her with the effect of a door
hard shut in the face of entreaty.</p>

<p>It was on that same day, as she walked slowly
toward home, leaving her fruitless letter in a trail
of tiny white fragments behind her, that the high-stepping
bay horse and the red-wheeled buggy again
passed her. She looked up involuntarily, her face
white and sad, to receive a cold stare and curt nod
from the man on the high seat. His whip-lash curled
cruelly around the slender flank of his horse as he
passed, and the sensitive creature sprang forward
with a lunge and a quiver, only to receive a second
and third stinging cut from the lash.</p>

<p>Barbara straightened herself as she watched the
light vehicle disappear around a turn in the road.</p>

<p>She was thinking with a vague terror that so he
would have tortured and driven her, cruelly, with no
hope of escape. She was not prepared to see him
return almost immediately at the same furious speed,
and still less for his words as he pulled up his foaming
horse.</p>

<p>“Get in,” he ordered her roughly. “I must speak
to you.”</p>

<p>She looked up at him, her gray eyes sparkling defiance
from under their long curling lashes.</p>

<p>“No,” she said loudly, “I will not.”</p>

<p>“Will not?” he repeated. “But I say you shall
listen to me.”</p>

<p>She walked on quietly. He stared after her with
a muttered oath, as if half-minded to go on. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
he leaped down, jerked his horse roughly to the
fence-rail, tied him fast, and strode after the slim
figure in the shabby black gown.</p>

<p>He overtook her in a few long strides. She turned
to face him in the middle of the muddy road.</p>

<p>“I told you I would leave you to yourself. I
meant to. I intended to let you be frightened,
harassed, driven to the wall; but I can’t,” he said
in a low, choked voice. “I&mdash;love you! I love you!
Do you hear me?”</p>

<p>She shrank back trembling before the man’s white
face and blazing eyes.</p>

<p>“I never knew before what it was like to&mdash;to love,”
he stammered. “But I do now. What did you mean
by saying that you would not&mdash;sell yourself for a
worn-out farm? Sell yourself&mdash;to me? Why, girl,
I’d give you all that I have&mdash;and my soul to the
devil for&mdash;&mdash; I’ll do anything you say, if you’ll
only marry me! I’ll give you a dozen farms.
I’ll&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop!” cried Barbara, her face slowly whitening.
“I&mdash;I am sorry I said that. I didn’t
mean&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you’ll marry me, Barbara&mdash;Barbara!”</p>

<p>His eyes devoured her.</p>

<p>“Listen,” he went on. “I’ve put in ten such
days and nights as I never expected to spend in this
or any other world.”</p>

<p>He gripped her by the arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“You&mdash;must love me,” he stormed. “I&mdash;I can’t
give you up!”</p>

<p>His shaken voice dropped into a low, pleading
tone.</p>

<p>“You’ll not believe it, Barbara. But I&mdash;didn’t
know what it was like to love anyone. Why should
I? I married for money&mdash;I’m not ashamed to tell
you. But Barbara! Barbara!”</p>

<p>The words rang out in a stifled cry, as he read
the fear&mdash;the aversion in hers.</p>

<p>She writhed out of his grasp, her breath coming
and going in little gasps.</p>

<p>“Stop!” she cried. “I&mdash;can’t listen!”</p>

<p>She clutched at the fence-rail as if she feared his
violence.</p>

<p>He folded his arms quietly, his face grown suddenly
rigid.</p>

<p>“Something has happened since the other day,”
he said. “What is it?”</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>He took two long steps and stood over her, big,
powerful, threatening.</p>

<p>“You shall answer me. Who or what is it that
has come between us?”</p>

<p>Again he waited for her to speak; but she stood
mute with bent head.</p>

<p>His clenched hands dropped at his side.</p>

<p>“You’ll not answer me,” he said, in a cold, hard
voice. “Well, be it so; go your way, and I’ll go
mine. But&mdash;I shall not give you up. You’re killing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
yourself with hard work; it is I who force you to it.
I am your master. You can’t escape me!”</p>

<p>“You are not my master!” she said wildly. “I’m
free&mdash;free!”</p>

<p>He turned without another look at her, his savage
heel grinding an innocent clover blossom into
the mud of the road.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">VIII</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">Barbara</span> stole softly down the creaking stair in the
gray obscurity of dawn, her shoes in one hand, a
smoking candle in the other. There was much to be
done, much to be thought of, and Jimmy must not
wake up to hinder for two full hours yet.</p>

<p>It was cold in the kitchen, and the faint pink light
streaming from the east shone in uncertainty through
misted panes. Barbara sat down, her red lips sternly
compressed, her dark brows drawn in a frowning
line above her eyes, and applied herself briskly to
lacing up her shoes. It was a relief to be accomplishing
something real, tangible, after the whirling
mist of dreams from which she had emerged shaken
and breathless. Dreams of any description seldom
visited Barbara’s healthily tired brain, but the vanished
darkness of the past night had been haunted
with confused visions. Now Stephen Jarvis was pursuing
her through trackless forests, where long
branches reached down like crooked, grasping hands.
Always she managed to elude her pursuer and always
he followed, his panting breath in her ears, till
suddenly stumbling and falling through a vast
crevasse in the darkness she found herself on a wide
plain, starred with narcissus, swaying spirit-like in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the bright air; high overhead white clouds floated
and the winds of May blew cool fragrance into her
face. At first she was alone, seeking for something,
she knew not what; then David Whitcomb stood at
her side.</p>

<p>“Come!” he cried imperiously, and his blue eyes
pleaded with hers. “We must make haste to escape
before the child overtakes us!”</p>

<p>She turned to follow his pointing finger and saw
Jimmy running toward them, his arms outstretched,
his bare, rosy feet stumbling amid the folds of his
long white gown. Then, with the wild irrelevancy
of dreams she heard the raucous voice of Thomas
Bellows, the auctioneer from Greenfield Centre, shouting
something indistinguishable in the far distance.
Instantly the wide plain, the impassioned lover, and
the running, stumbling little figure vanished. She
was at home now, hurrying in anxious haste from
room to room to find everything empty and desolate
and the sun shining in through dimmed window-panes
on the bare floors. Outside on the lawn a
confused pile of household furniture, books, and
carpets, looking sadly worn and old in the pitiless
light of day, were being rapidly sold under the
hammer.</p>

<p>“Here you are, ladies an’ gents,” shouted the
auctioneer, “lot number twenty-four, a strong,
healthy young woman, kind an’ willin’! A good cook
an’ housekeeper. How much am I offered? Come,
ladies, let me hear your bids!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>The faint light of morning touching her closed
eyelids like a cool finger-tip suddenly aroused the
girl to a consciousness of reality (if indeed the experiences
of this mortal life be more real than
dreams). She rose at once, dressed hastily, and
having by now finished the lacing up of her shoes
stood gazing out at the familiar door-yard with
gathered brows.</p>

<p>“I ought,” said Barbara half-aloud in the silence
of the kitchen, “to be good for something.” She
looked down at her young strong hands; hands
skilled in many uses, her forehead still puckered with
unaccustomed thoughts.</p>

<p>Then she opened the back door quietly, for she
was still mindful of the sleeping child above, and
went out into the frosty dawn. A robin was singing
loudly in the top of the budding elm down by the
gate.</p>

<p>“Cheer up! Cheer up!” the jubilant bird voice
seemed to be saying. Then the song ceased and the
strong brown wings spread and carried the voice toward
the dawn, which now flung long streamers of
rose and gold athwart the frigid blue of the sky. A
bright, cold moon swung low in the west and the
distant houses of the village, huddled close among
dark folds of the hills, began to send up delicate
spirals of smoke which ascended and hung motionless
in mid-heaven, like unshriven ghosts.</p>

<p>Peg Morrison was washing the mud off the wheels
of the old buggy to the tune of Denis, lugubriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
wafted to the winds of morning through his
nose.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Blest be-hee th’ tie-hi which bi-inds,<br />
Aour ha-ur-uts in Chris-his-chun lo-ove;<br />
Th’ fe-hell-o-shi-hip of ki-hin-dred mi-hinds,<br />
Is li-hike to tha-hat above!”</p>

<p class="p1">“Peg!” cried Barbara, in her imperious young
voice.</p>

<p>The old man stopped short in his rendition of
Fawcett’s immortal stanzas, an apologetic smile over-spreading
his features.</p>

<p>“Good-mornin’, Miss Barb’ry,” he said. “A nice,
pleasant mornin’, ain’t it? Thinks I, I’ll wash
up this ’ere buggy an’ make it look’s well’s I kin.
Then, mebbe, ’long towards arternoon I’ll git ’round
t’ call on th’ Hon’rable Stephen Jarvis. I reckon
I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No,” interrupted Barbara decidedly, “you
mustn’t do that. It wouldn’t do any good,” she
added, in anticipation of protest.</p>

<p>“It’s th’ matter o’ th’ onions I was thinkin’ o’
bringin’ to his attention,” said Peg, raising his voice.
“‘F I c’n prove to th’ Hon’rable Stephen Jarvis
that onions’ll raise that goll-durned mortgage within
one year f’om date, I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Peg,” protested Barbara indignantly, “how do
you suppose I’m ever going to train Jimmy to speak
properly if you persist in using such language?”</p>

<p>“Meanin’ th’ expression goll-durned, o’ course,
Miss Barb’ry,” acquiesced the old man meekly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
“You’re right, I ain’t no manner o’ business to use
swear words b’fore ladies. But that consarned,
measly&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The girl stamped her foot impatiently.</p>

<p>“There’s no use talking to you,” she said sharply.
“I’ll just have to keep Jimmy away from you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do that, Miss Barb’ry; please don’t!”
pleaded Peg. “I won’t do him no real harm. I
ain’t no-ways vicious, ner&mdash;ner low-down; an’ that
little chap&mdash;&mdash; Why, Miss Barb’ry, me an’ th’ Cap’n
’s been a chumin’ it sence he could crawl out t’ th’
barn on ’is han’s an’ knees. Ef he don’t fall int’ no
worse comp’ny ’n Peleg Morrison’s, I guess the
Cap’n ’ll come out all right. An’ you kin bet your
bottom dollar onto it.”</p>

<p>Peg swashed the remaining water in his pail over
the hind wheel of the buggy with an air of stern
finality.</p>

<p>“Of course I know you’re good, Peg,” murmured
Barbara contritely. “I didn’t mean&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it, Miss Barb’ry,” interrupted
Mr. Morrison, with generous politeness. “Your
tongue gits the start o’ your jedgment occasionally,
same’s your pa’s ust to, but I shan’t lay it up ’gainst
you. Any more”&mdash;and he raised his voice in anticipation
of a possible interruption&mdash;“any more’n I
done in the past.” His eyes twinkled kindly at the
girl.</p>

<p>“I want you to harness the buggy for me after
breakfast, Peg,” Barbara said soberly. “I’m going&mdash;somewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
on business, and I want to start
early.”</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Blest be he th’ tie-hi which bi-inds.”</p>

<p class="pn1">warbled Peg unmelodiously, as he stooped to apply
his wet sponge to the rear springs.</p>

<p>“Did you hear me, Peg?” demanded Barbara.</p>

<p>The old man gazed reproachfully at the girl
through the spokes of the wheel.</p>

<p>“W’y, I’m goin’ to use the horses fer ploughin’
this mornin’, Miss Barb’ry,” he said soothingly.
“An’ they’ll be all tuckered out b’ night.”</p>

<p>“But there’s no use of doing any more ploughing.
I told you that last week. Unless I can manage
somehow to&mdash;to raise the money, the farm&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t say it!” interrupted Peg. “I don’t b’lieve
in namin’ troubles. It helps ’em to ketch a
body, someway, to notice ’em too much. I b’lieve
in actin’ ’s if the’ wa’nt anythin’ th’ matter ’s long
’s ye kin.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and while you’re doing it the mortgage will
foreclose itself,” Barbara said, recalling Stephen
Jarvis’ curt phrase with a thrill of anger. “You
hitch up Billy for me and bring him around at seven
o’clock. Will you do it, please, Peg?”</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“The fe-hell-o-shi-hip of k-hin-dred mi-hinds!”</p>

<p class="pn1">chanted Mr. Morrison, with entire irrelevance.</p>

<p>“Very well, if you won’t, I’ll walk. It’s ten miles
there and back, but you won’t care, as long as you
have your own way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where was you thinkin’ of goin’, Miss Barb’ry?”
demanded Peg cautiously. “Ye know I ain’t set
on anythin’ that ain’t fer your good&mdash;yours an’ the
Cap’n’s.”</p>

<p>But Barbara had already disappeared in a flutter
of angry haste.</p>

<p>“Now, I s’pose,” soliloquized Mr. Morrison,
“that I’ll actually hev to give up ploughin’ the hill
lot this mornin’, an’ all ’long o’ that young female.”
He shook his head solemnly.</p>

<p>“O Lord!” he burst out, “you know Miss Barb’ry,
prob’bly’s well’s I do. She’s a mighty nice
girl an’ always hes been; but she’s turrible set in her
ways, an’ I declar’ I can’t see what in creation she’s
a-goin’ to do; what with everythin’&mdash;you know now&mdash;I’ve
spoke ’bout it frequent enough. Then the’s
the Hon’rable Stephen Jarvis&mdash;him that holds th’
mortgage&mdash;he wants t’ marry her. But I don’ trust
that man, Lord. I don’t know how he looks to you.
But to me he ’pears hard-fisted, an’ closer’n the bark
to a tree, an’ I c’n tell you he licks the hide off’n
his horses right along. But the’ may be some good in
him. Ef the’ is, bring it out, O Lord, so ’t folks kin
see it. An’ fix things up with Miss Barb’ry, somehow.
Kind o’ overrule Jarvis an’ the mortgage an’ all the
rest, the way you know how. Amen!”</p>

<p>Peleg Morrison was on intimate terms with his
Creator, and on this occasion, as in the past, he
derived such satisfaction from his converse with the
Almighty that he was enabled presently to go on with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
his vocal exercises. The washing of the buggy was
thus happily completed, the worn cushions dusted,
and the horses fed and watered by the time the sun
peeped over the fringes of dark woods. At seven
o’clock, as he was tying the wall-eyed bay to the
hitching-post in the side yard, Barbara appeared in
the open door, a brown loaf in her hand.</p>

<p>“Here’s some fresh bread for your breakfast,
Peg,” she said. She glanced at the horse. “I
shan’t be gone very long. You can plough when I
come back, if you want to. It won’t hurt the
ground to plough it.”</p>

<p>“The mare’s kind o’ skittish this mornin’,” replied
Peg, accepting the addition to his meagre bill of
fare with an appreciative grin. “Mebbe I’d better
go ’long an’ drive.” He glanced anxiously at the
girl. “I wouldn’t do nothin’ rash ef I was you,
Miss Barb’ry; like&mdash;like gittin’ engaged to be married,
or anythin’ like that.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, Peg,” Barbara said soberly, “that’s
precisely what I don’t mean to do.”</p>

<p>She felt entirely sure of herself now, even while
her cheeks burned hotly at the remembrance of
Jarvis’ look when he said, “I am your master.”</p>

<p>“I’ll scrub floors for a living,” she promised herself,
“before I yield to him.”</p>

<p>All the pride of a strong nature shone in her eyes
as she stooped over Jimmy, sitting at the table, his
short legs dangling, his slate pencil squeakily setting
down queer crooked figures in straggling rows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m ahead in my ’rithmetic,” the little boy announced
triumphantly. “I’m doin’ reg’lar zamples.
I like zamples. An’ bimeby I’ll be all growed up, an’
nen I’ll take care of you, Barb’ra.”</p>

<p>She kissed him underneath the short yellow curls
in the back of his neck.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jimmy,” she sighed, “I wish you were grown
up now!”</p>

<p>The child straightened himself anxiously.</p>

<p>“My head’s way above your belt when I stand
up,” he said, “‘n’ I ate lots of brown bread an’ milk
for breakfast. I’m growing jus’ as fast’s I can.”</p>

<p>Barbara hugged him remorsefully.</p>

<p>“You’re just big enough&mdash;for six,” she assured
him. “And&mdash;and we’ll come out all right, somehow.
We just will, precious!”</p>

<p>“‘Course we will,” echoed the child. He slipped
from his chair and eyed his sister with a searching
gaze.</p>

<p>“If you’re scared of anybody, Barb’ra,” he said
valiantly, “I’ll take a big stick, ’n’&mdash;’n’&mdash;I’ll&mdash;I’ll&mdash;I
won’t let anybody hurt you, Barb’ra!”</p>

<p>The girl laughed rather unsteadily as she hurried
him into his coat and cap. “Learn a lot at school,
dear,” she murmured, “and you’ll have the best kind
of a big stick.”</p>

<p>The remembrance of his warm little arms about
her neck comforted her as she drove the wall-eyed
mare along the road. She was going to do a very
strange thing. Something she had never heard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
any woman doing before. Just how the idea had
taken form and substance in her mind she did not
know. She appeared to herself to have awakened
with the resolve fully formed, distinctly outlined, even
to the small details, which she busily reviewed while
she was tying the horse before the house of Thomas
Bellows, auctioneer. There was a shop in the lower
front story of the house, which had once been a
piazza, but now protruded with two bulging front
windows to the edge of the sidewalk. The windows
disclosed a variety of objects in the line of household
appurtenances, clocks, flatirons, a pile of tin-ware,
likewise a yellow placard reading, “Auction
to-day,” surmounted by a professional flag of a faded
red color.</p>

<p>Mr. Bellows himself, in blue overalls and a pink
shirt, was occupied in wiping off an exceedingly dusty
and ancient sewing machine with an oily rag. He
looked up sharply as the discordant jangle of the bell
announced the opening of his shop door.</p>

<p>“Good-mornin’, miss,” he said as Barbara entered.
“If you don’t mind shuttin’ that door behind you.
It beats all how cold the wind stays, don’t it? You
want to look over some o’ these goods, heh? Household
effects of the widow Small down to the Corners.
Died las’ week, an’ her daughter don’t want to keep
none o’ her things. They’ll be sold at two sharp. It
ain’t a bad idea to cast yer eye around a little b’fore
the biddin’ begins. Things show off better. Now
this ’ere machine&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t want to buy anything,” stammered Barbara.
“I&mdash;want you to sell something for me.”</p>

<p>“Yas,” assented Mr. Bellows explosively, standing
up and resting a grimy hand on either hip, the while
he surveyed Barbara’s slim figure attentively. “Jus’
so! Well?” he added tentatively. “Sellin’ things
fer folks is my business. What d’ye offer: goods,
stock, or real estate? It’s all the same to me.”</p>

<p>“It&mdash;it isn’t&mdash;&mdash; Could you sell my work for
me? I mean&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The man stared hard at the girl, his squinting
eyes puckered, his mouth drawn close at the corners.</p>

<p>“I’m a gen’ral auctioneer,” he announced conclusively.
“It’s m’ business to sell household effects,
stock, or real estate, on commission.”</p>

<p>“I want some money&mdash;a good deal of money,”
Barbara went on, “and I want it right away.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen folks in your fix before,” commented the
auctioneer dryly, as he again applied himself to the
sewing machine. “I gen’rally make out t’ sell what’s
offered. But I can’t guarantee prices.”</p>

<p>“You sell horses, don’t you?” demanded Barbara.</p>

<p>“Horses? Sure!”</p>

<p>“And&mdash;and oxen. They’re meant to work, and
people buy them to work. That’s what I want to do.
I want to work for three&mdash;or four years, if I must;
and I want the money all at once&mdash;in advance.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know as I ketch your idee,” said Mr.
Bellows. “You want money, an’ you want it right
away, an’ you want me to sell&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“I want you to sell my work&mdash;honest work, housework,
any kind of work that I can do, for&mdash;for a
term of years.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bellows abandoned further efforts at bettering
the condition of the late Widow Small’s sewing
machine. He stood up and scowled meditatively at
Barbara.</p>

<p>“Seems t’ me I’ve seen you b’fore, somewheres;
haven’t I?”</p>

<p>“My name is Barbara Preston,” the girl said
haughtily.</p>

<p>“An’ you want I should&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“When people buy a horse they really buy and
pay for the labor of that horse in advance,” Barbara
said composedly. “I am more valuable
than a horse. I have skill, intelligence; I wish
to sell&mdash;my skill, my intelligence to the highest
bidder.”</p>

<p>“Well, I swan!” exclaimed Mr. Bellows. Then he
fell to laughing noisily, his wizened countenance
drawn into curious folds and puckers of mirth.</p>

<p>Barbara waited unsmilingly.</p>

<p>“Say! d’you know I’ve been asked to sell mos’
everythin’ you ever heard of,” said Mr. Bellows, getting
the better of his hilarity, “but I never was asked
to sell&mdash;a girl. A good-lookin’, smart, likely girl.
I guess you’re jokin’, miss. It wouldn’t do, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Why wouldn’t it?” urged Barbara.</p>

<p>“Well, it wouldn’t; that’s all. I’ve got m’ reputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
as an auctioneer to think about; an’&mdash;lemme
see, your folks is all dead, ain’t they?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Barbara. “I have a brother six years
old.”</p>

<p>Her dry tongue refused to add to this statement.
She was conscious of an inward tremor of fear lest
he should refuse.</p>

<p>“Whatever put such a curious notion into your
head?” Mr. Bellows wanted to know.</p>

<p>“I may as well tell you,” the girl said bitterly.
“You’ll be asked to sell me out soon. We’re going
to lose everything we’ve got&mdash;Jimmy and I; the farm,
the&mdash;furniture&mdash;everything.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say!” Mr. Bellows commented doubtfully.
“Well, that had ought to net you something&mdash;eh?”</p>

<p>“We shan’t have anything; everything will be
gone,” the girl said coldly.</p>

<p>“Sho! that’s too bad,” Mr. Bellows said good-naturedly.
He stuck his thumbs into the arm-holes
of his vest, and scowled absent-mindedly into space.
Then he looked at Barbara again. “Mortgage&mdash;eh?”
he suggested. “Coverin’ pretty much everythin’&mdash;eh?”</p>

<p>“Everything,” repeated Barbara, in a dull tone.</p>

<p>“Everythin’&mdash;save an’ exceptin’ one smart, willin’
young woman&mdash;eh? You’d ought to bring a purty
good figger&mdash;in the right market.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bellows paused to give way to mirth once
more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“The matrimonial market’s the one partic’lar
field I ain’t had much ’xperience in,” he concluded.
“An’ auctionin’ off goods of the sort you mention
ain’t ’xactly in my line, an’ that’s a fac’, miss. So I
guess&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand,” Barbara interrupted
quickly. “Let me explain. When I found that everything
was lost”&mdash;her voice trembled in spite of
herself&mdash;“I thought at first I would teach school&mdash;let
the farm go and teach&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t you do that?” Mr. Bellows inquired.
He was a kind-hearted man, with sympathies
somewhat blunted by his professional zeal in a calling
which for the most part concerned itself with
clearing away the wreckage of human hopes. “You’d
make a right smart school-ma’am, I should say.”</p>

<p>“I’m not a normal school graduate,” Barbara
told him. “Besides, they have no vacancies. Then I
tried to get sewing to do. I can sew neatly. But I
might easily starve on what I could earn with my
needle. A woman told me she knew of someone who
wanted&mdash;a&mdash;servant,” Barbara’s voice shook, but she
went on bravely. “She said that people sometimes
paid as much as twenty-five dollars a month for
such work. And that it wasn’t easy to find women
who could do that kind of work well. I said I would
not work in another woman’s kitchen. But I&mdash;I am
willing to do it, if I can sell my work for twelve
hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” ejaculated Mr. Bellows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“It sounds like a lot of money, I know,” Barbara
went on; “but it is four years’ service at twenty-five
dollars a month. I want it all at once. Then I
can pay the mortgage on our farm, and keep it.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” commented Mr. Bellows explosively.</p>

<p>“I could lease the farm while I was working, and
it would bring in enough money to take care of
Jimmy.”</p>

<p>Her face clouded swiftly at the thought of the
possible separation.</p>

<p>“Wall, I don’t know of anybody who’d be willin’
to pay down any twelve hundred dollars spot cash
for a <i>hired girl</i>,” objected Mr. Bellows. “Y’ couldn’t
get nobody to bid on a proposition like that. Y’
might”&mdash;the man hesitated, then went on harshly,
“y’ might up an’ die, or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A man on the farm next to ours paid three hundred
dollars for a horse, and it died the next week,”
Barbara said quietly. “Then he bought another.
He had to have a horse.”</p>

<p>“Well, he owned it for good an’ all, an’ you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll work four years-or five for the money,” said
Barbara steadily. “And I shall be worth far more
than an ordinary servant.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bellows wagged his head argumentatively.
“I’d hev to charge you five per cent.,” he warned
her. “An’ you couldn’t get any bidders, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“That,” said Barbara, “would be my affair.
What I want to know is, will you sell me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>The blood hammered in her temples; her hands
and feet were icy cold; but she eyed the man steadily.</p>

<p>Mr. Bellows had been making a rapid mental calculation.</p>

<p>“W’y, I don’ know,” he said, scratching his head
reflectively. “I don’t want to go int’ no fool job
fer nothin’. M’ time’s valu’ble.”</p>

<p>“I’ll pay you&mdash;ten dollars, if&mdash;if&mdash;no one buys
me,” said Barbara faintly.</p>

<p>Mr. Bellows bit his thumb-nail thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“All right!” he burst out at length. “You
name the day, git th’ bidders t’gether an’ I’ll auction
ye off. Gracious! It don’t sound right, some way.”</p>

<p>He looked at the girl carefully, real human kindness
in his eyes and voice.</p>

<p>“Who holds your mortgage, anyhow?” he asked
indignantly. “I sh’d think most anybody’d be
ashamed o’ themselves t’ drive a nice young woman
like you to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If I can realize enough money to pay what I
owe I shall be&mdash;glad,” the girl said. “I am obliged
to work hard anyway. My plan will pay, if it succeeds;
don’t you see it will?”</p>

<p>“W’y, yes; I see all right. I don’t b’lieve you
c’n work it, though,” was Mr. Bellows’ opinion.</p>

<p>Barbara did not explain her intentions further.
She requested Mr. Bellows to say nothing of what
had passed between them, and this he readily promised.</p>

<p>“‘Tain’t a matter t’ make common talk of,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
agreed, with a dubious shake of the head. “The’s
folks that might not ketch the right idee. Sellin’ a
pretty girl at auction ’ud draw a crowd all right;
but I’d advise you t’ let me use my jedgment ’bout
biddin’ ye in, if it’s necessary.”</p>

<h2 class="pc4">IX</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">As</span> a man thinketh in his heart, so is that man, was
the Nazarene’s succinct announcement of a law as
ancient and immutable as the correlated principles
which govern gravity and motion. From the beginning
of things visible, when the thoughts of the great
I Am first began to fashion new and strange creations
out of the whirling fire mist, until now, the thoughts
of a God&mdash;of a man, continually and inevitably mould
his appearance and the circumstances of his existence.
As there can be no question as to the reality
of this fundamental principle at the root of all
phenomena, so there can be no evasion of its action
and effect.</p>

<p>Stephen Jarvis, having successfully achieved
wealth by a constant and unremitting application
of his powerful ego to the thoughts of money-getting
by any and all means, looked the part. No man can
do otherwise. Having chosen his rôle, he proceeds
to a make-up more skilful and complete than can
be conceived by the bungler in the actor’s dressing-room.
Upon the plastic mask of the body his
thoughts etch themselves, his habits paint themselves,
his character blazons itself, till at middle age, he cannot
longer hide himself from the observant eye of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
world. He is, in appearance, in reality, what his
thoughts have made him.</p>

<p>If it be possible to imagine the havoc which the
oft-quoted bull in the china shop would create by a
sudden and unpremeditated use of his brute force,
one may, perhaps, conceive of the inward tumult, the
confusion, the very real loss, and consequent anguish
entailed upon a man like Jarvis by the sudden invasion
of a genuine passion.</p>

<p>A thousand times he railed at himself, profanely
calling himself many varieties of a fool. Once and
again he strove to restore to cold, passionless order
the seething maelstrom of his thoughts. Why, he
demanded fiercely of himself, should he long to possess
this girl with every aching fibre of his being?
The mere urge and fever of animal passion did not
explain the matter; there was something deeper, more
elemental still in the fury of the desire which possessed
him, which drove him forth out of his comfortable
house by night and by day as if pursued
by the furies. Because Jarvis was a strong man, his
nature hardened by years of stern, unrelaxing self-discipline,
the utter rout and confusion of his cold,
passionless self was the more complete and disastrous.
He hated himself for loving a woman who disdained
him, and hating himself, he loved her with a despair
akin to torment. That she was poor, helpless, already
fast closed in his savage grip, like a bird in a
snare, he knew; and yet for the first time he dimly
realized the illusive part of her which successfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
evaded his grasp, defied his power, despised
his threats. He might, if he would, crush her
by main force; he could not compel her to love
him.</p>

<p>The thought of his own strength, helpless before
her weakness, maddened him. Houses, lands, money,
had become passively obedient to the power of his
will. He controlled these things, did with them as
he pleased, in effect an overlord, haughty, unbending,
merciless; but this one thing which he had put
out his hand to take&mdash;carelessly, as one will pluck a
ripe apple from the bough at the languid prompting
of appetite&mdash;this girl, who had for years been no
more to him than the birds hopping in the trees outside
his window, how and by what means had she
suddenly contrived to gain this monstrous ascendency
over him? What uncanny power in those clear
gray eyes of hers had metamorphosed Stephen Jarvis,
cool, middle-aged man of affairs, into the weak
creature he had always despised in his saner moments?</p>

<p>During these days of inward tumult he carried
on the dull routine of his business, forcing himself
to the task with all the powers of a will suddenly
turned traitor to its master. In spite of himself
he seemed to see her there in his lonely house over
against the sombre rows of books, her face vividly
alive, defiantly youthful. Despite his resolves she
perpetually came between him and the printed page
which he strove to read; worst of all, she haunted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
his restless slumbers by night, now pleading with
him; now defying him; mocking him with elfin laughter,
as she fled before him, the child in her arms; while
he pursued leaden-footed through uncounted miles
of shadowy country.</p>

<p>The two did not meet face to face, while the rains
and chilling winds of April gradually spent themselves,
and the grass, illumined with a thousand
cheerful sunbursts of dandelions, grew long under
the blossoming trees. The mated birds sang only at
dawn now, being too busy with the rapturous labors
of nest-building to pause for vocal expression of
their gladness. In the fields staid farm-horses indulged
in unwonted gambols and nosed their mates
with little whinnying cries; grazing cattle lifted their
heads from the sweet springing grass to gaze with
large wistful eyes at the widespread landscape. Once,
long ago, they had roamed the unfenced pastures of
the world in May, herded cows and yearlings, and
the lordly bulls leading on, while the urge and rapture
of the returning sun brooded the earth, compelling
it to bring forth after its kind. Though she
did not see him, yet none the less Jarvis obtruded
his harsh visage into Barbara’s thoughts by day and
by night. Nor could a wiser man than Jarvis have
guessed that the girl was literally enfolded in cloudy
thought forms, projected toward her from his own
brain, with all the accuracy and certainty of an electric
current traversing the viewless paths of air
between wireless stations. That we do not understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
these phenomena with any degree of accuracy
does not render them the less effective.</p>

<p>It was still early in May when Jarvis drove over
to inspect a wood-pulp factory in the neighborhood
of Greenfield Centre. Its proprietor had borrowed
capital heavily within the past year, and Jarvis had
been narrowly watching the gradual ebb of the factory’s
output. It was the old story of misapplied
energy, paralyzed into inaction by impending failure.
Jarvis scored the luckless proprietor mercilessly
during their brief interview; later he sought the
services of Thomas Bellows, the auctioneer.</p>

<p>“You may sell him out, plant, machinery, and all;
reserve nothing,” Jarvis ordered; and, referring to
his book of memoranda, added the date.</p>

<p>Another entry that he saw there met his sombre
eyes. He stared at it frowningly.</p>

<p>“Anythin’ more in my line in the near future?”
Mr. Bellows wanted to know.</p>

<p>He rubbed his hands as he asked the question. The
Honorable Stephen Jarvis was, as he put it, “a
stiddy customer and a good one,” being constantly
in need of Mr. Bellows’ services.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jarvis, a dull red flush rising in his
sallow face. “The contents of the Preston house,
the stock, and implements, must be sold on June
first.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bellows struck one hairy fist into the other
by way of preface to his words. He was not afraid
of Stephen Jarvis, being sufficiently well provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
with worldly goods, albeit these were for the most
part second-hand, and in the nature of left-overs
from many auctions.</p>

<p>“It seems a pity,” quoth Bellows, “to sell her
out. Couldn’t you wait till fall, say, and give the
little Preston girl a chance? I ain’t what you might
call soft m’self; but I’m blamed if I could help
feelin’ sorry for the girl when she come in here one
day last week t’ engage my professional services.”</p>

<p>“What is Miss Preston proposing to sell?” demanded
Jarvis. Something in his voice gave Mr. Bellows
a curious sensation. He gave Jarvis a sharp
look as he answered.</p>

<p>“Nothing that belongs to you, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Tell me what it is,” repeated Jarvis. “I’ll be the
best judge of that,” His voice shook, and also the
hand which held the leather book of fateful dates and
occasions.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry; but I guess I can’t ’commodate you,”
responded the other. “Perfessional etiquette, you
know; in this ’ere case binding.”</p>

<p>“You have no right to refuse,” said Jarvis, and
something of the real nature of his secret thoughts
flared up in his eyes. “Everything that concerns
Miss Preston concerns me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bellows was puzzled.</p>

<p>“Meanin’, of course, that you hold the lien on her
prop’ty,” he hazarded. “But you don’t”&mdash;and he
paused to chuckle to himself&mdash;“hold no lien on what
she’s propos in’ to sell to the highest bidder?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you mean?” demanded Jarvis.</p>

<p>His tone was menacing, and he fixed angry eyes,
red from sleeplessness, on the old auctioneer.</p>

<p>“You’ll either explain yourself,” he said, “or&mdash;you’ll
get no more business from me, to-day or any
other day.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bellows expectorated violently in the general
direction of the opposite wall.</p>

<p>“I ain’t,” he declared valiantly, “afeard of no
threats, nor yet of nobody. But I’m goin’ to tell
you, ’cause it’s you that’s drove her to it, an’ you’d
ought to know what sort of girl she is. I had three-quarters
of a notion to tell you anyhow, an’ I tol’
m’ wife so, when I found it was you that held the lien
on her house an’ furniture. Business is business
with me as well as any other man; but I’d be ashamed
to drive a woman to the point of sellin’ herself.”</p>

<p>“<i>Selling herself!</i>” echoed Jarvis.</p>

<p>The observant eyes of Mr. Bellows were upon him,
as he fell back a pace or two and strove to steady
himself.</p>

<p>“That’s what I said. Yes, sir; she asked me
right here in this shop to sell her at public auction.
‘I’ve lost everythin’,’ she says; ‘but I’ve got myself,
an’ I’ll sell that, an’ pay what I owe.’”</p>

<p>“My God!” breathed Jarvis. “I&mdash;drove her to
it!”</p>

<p>“You’re right, you did,” agreed Mr. Bellows.</p>

<p>“You can’t do it, man. I forbid it!”</p>

<p>“Oh, y’ do; do ye? Wall, I don’t see how you’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
going to make out to prevent it. The girl’s got a
right to herself, and I’ve got a right to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I shall prevent it,” Jarvis interrupted fiercely.
“It’s inhuman&mdash;uncivilized, monstrous!”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the way it struck me&mdash;at first,” acquiesced
Mr. Bellows; “but the way she put it up t’
me kind of won me over. She’s a takin’ sort of girl,
kind o’ good-lookin’, an’ innercent. W’y, Lord bless
you, she’s no more idee of the way a man&mdash;like you,
for instance&mdash;might look at it than a child. She
wants to work out&mdash;for a matter o’ four or five years,
she says; an’ she thinks she c’n get some fool woman
to bid twelve hunderd dollars spot cash fer bein’ sure
of a hired girl all that time&mdash;‘W’y,’ I says to her,
‘you might up an’ die,’ ‘Yes,’ she says, ‘so might a
horse; but folks hes to hev horses!’ I tell you she’s
cute an’ bright, an’ I’m goin’ to sell her to the highest
bidder, same’s I agreed to.”</p>

<p>Jarvis was silent for a long minute, his eyes fixed
unseeingly on the miscellaneous collection of shabby
and broken furniture in the rear of the shop.</p>

<p>“Is it to be a public sale?” he asked coolly.</p>

<p>“Well, as t’ that, I can’t rightly tell you. I left
the advertisin’ o’ the goods, an’ the date o’ sale to
the young lady. I reelly hope you will call it off.
I s’pose you c’n easy fix things up so ’t she&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Did she ask you to tell me this?” demanded
Jarvis suddenly. “Tell me the facts.”</p>

<p>“Did she ask me&mdash;to tell you?” echoed Mr. Bellows
wonderingly. “You bet she didn’t! You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
wasn’t named betwixt us. I asked her who held the
lien on her prop’ty, an’ she didn’t answer. Thought
it was none o’ my business, likely. I suspicioned it
was you, though. You get most of ’em around these
parts.”</p>

<p>Jarvis made no reply. He closed the red leather
book, slipped it into an inside pocket, then deliberately
drew on his driving gloves.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me the date of this&mdash;this sale?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“What you want t’ know for? Thinkin’ of puttin’
in a bid?” chuckled Mr. Bellows.</p>

<p>Jarvis gave him a terrible look.</p>

<p>“I’d advise you to keep still about this. Don’t
attempt to interest anyone else in Miss Preston’s
affairs. Do you hear?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t deef,” responded Mr. Bellows in an aggrieved
voice. “‘N’ I don’t know’s I see what business
’tis of yours, anyhow. Mebbe she’ll get the
money an’ pay you. ’Twouldn’t surprise me if she
did. She’s bound she will, an’ where there’s a will
there’s a way, I’ve heard tell.”</p>

<p>“The date, man; give me the date!”</p>

<p>“Seein’ I’ve told you so much, I s’pose you might
as well know; the sale’s set for the eighteenth.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“At her house.”</p>

<p>“And you’re actually going to&mdash;&mdash; No; she’ll
never do it. She won’t be able to bring herself to
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wall, I’ll bet you ten dollars she will; d’ye take
me?”</p>

<p>Jarvis turned without another word and left the
place. He suddenly felt the need of the outdoor air.
Barbara’s desperate expedient convinced him as no
words of hers could have done of the hopelessness of
his case. “She hates me,” he told himself; and for
the first time he looked within for a reason for her
aversion.</p>

<p>He drove slowly, his thoughts a mad whirl of fury
and despair. For the first time he saw himself as he
fancied he must look to her, a man past his first
youth, cold, forbidding, harsh, unlovely. He perceived
with a flash of prescience that she cared nothing
for money, save as it signified the thing she held
most dear; nothing for the position, power, and
luxury for which he had sold his honor and his manhood.
Stripped of these things, what must he appear
in her eyes? A monster of selfishness and greed, no
less; to be feared, detested, escaped by any means
even to the sacrifice of brain and body. He groaned
aloud in the scorching flame of his humiliation.</p>

<p>He told himself that he would go to her, beg her
forgiveness, offer her all that she had asked for, and
more. He would give her the farm free of all indebtedness.
Then he realized, with sickening certainty,
that she would not accept anything from him.
He had told her that he was her master. To escape
this slavery she was about to sell herself to another.
The thought was insupportable. Even while he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
perceived her perfect ingenuousness and the practical
realization of her own worth which lay beneath this
fantastic and seemingly impossible plan of hers, he
sensed its frightful danger. In order to attract bidders
she would be forced to advertise her plans. Who
would respond? Who would buy, and for what purpose?</p>

<p>He whipped his horse to a furious speed and soon
reached his house. The newspapers, unread for days,
were piled on a table near his desk. He seized one,
turned to its advertising columns and rapidly reviewed
their contents, then another, and another in
rapid succession. At last his devouring eyes lighted
and fastened upon a single paragraph, hidden among
the miscellaneous advertisements where a puzzled
proofreader had doubtless placed it:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“For Sale at Auction [he read]: A young woman in good
health, able and willing to do housework and plain sewing; or
could teach a little child and care for it, would like to secure a
position with a respectable family for a term of years. Her
services will be disposed of at private auction to the highest bidder,
for a term of three, four, or five years. Please communicate with
B., <i>Telegram</i>.”</p>

<p class="p1">Jarvis crushed the paper in his hands savagely, as
though he would destroy the strange little appeal to
an unfriendly world. Then he sought for and read
it again, his eyes fixed and frowning.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">X</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">There</span> are times when to the unintelligent observer
the affairs of this world appear a hopeless tangle, a
web without a pattern, a heap of unclassified material
without an architect, a wild, unmeaning chaos
of things animate and inanimate, all grinding, groaning,
clashing together, sport of the gods or of
demons, tending towards nothing, useless, hideous.
But to one who views the world from another and
higher level there sometimes appear illumining hints
of harmony and completeness, tokens of a Master
Mind working continually among the affairs of men
and universes, setting all in divine order, either with
or without the understanding and co-operation of
the lesser intelligences.</p>

<p>Thus when Barbara Preston was impelled, she
knew not how, to send forth her strange and piteous
little appeal to the unknown, it found instant response,
and proceeded to fit itself into the scheme
of things as perfectly and as cunningly as a tiny bit
in a picture puzzle. The paper in which it appeared
passed into the hands of a great number of persons,
who glanced carelessly at its glaring headlines or
searched painstakingly through its losts and founds
or things offered, or help wanted, according to their
varied tastes or necessities. On the second day thereafter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
as was also to be expected, the particular
edition containing the queer little unclassified appeal,
found its way to many ash-cans, waste-paper
baskets, bureau drawers, and pantry shelves; in its
progress it helped to build numberless fires, it wrapped
parcels of every conceivable shape and size; it fluttered
out of car windows, across decks of steamers
and ferry-boats; it floated and dissolved in many
waterways, and finally disappeared, swallowed in the
abyss which appears always to yawn for all things
of human creation. Having vanished mysteriously,
unobtrusively, as must every printed page sooner or
later, it nevertheless left its mark on the lives of
many. Plans were changed, voyages undertaken or
abandoned, marriages made and unmade. In a word,
prosperity, ruin, joy, sadness, glory, despair&mdash;all
came about through its appearance, and persisted
in ever widening circles after it had passed from sight
and mind.</p>

<p>Four men and ten women, to be exact, of those
who chanced to notice Barbara’s somewhat absurd
little advertisement, cut it out of the doomed sheet,
and placed it in securer quarters, for further consideration.
Of the women four wrote to Barbara
asking for references; of the men, one conceived it
to be “a business opportunity,” not to be written
of here; one was a widower blessed with three small
unruly children and little appetite for further matrimonial
experience; another a rich, crabbed old miser,
bent on escaping designing relatives, and the fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
an enterprising young mining engineer, very deeply
in love with a pretty girl and anxious to marry her
and take her with him to a region remote from
civilization. The girl had sighed, demurred, wept&mdash;she
was of the delicate, clinging vine variety, and
totally unfit for the hard experiences of a mining
camp. But to this fact the amorous engineer was
quite naturally oblivious. He dilated glowingly
upon the wonderful efficiency of Chinese servants,
who could, he assured her, beat creation in the expert
disguising of the inevitable “canned goods,”
which formed the staple of provision. Her questions
and those of her mother elicited the fact that there
were no women to be hired in any capacity, the wives
of the miners, for the most part, being of a free
and independent nature, and, moreover, entirely occupied
with their own affairs.</p>

<p>Mamma looked at Ethel, and Ethel looked at
Mamma; Mamma’s glance being dubious and Ethel’s
timidly imploring.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t think of allowing darling Ethel to go
away out there to that dreary, lonely place, with no
one to wait on her and take care of her except a
Chinese man,” Mamma said tearfully. She added
that Ethel was delicate, very delicate.</p>

<p>“The mountain air will make her strong,” declared
the engineer enthusiastically. Then he gazed
lovingly at the slight, pale, fashionably gowned
young woman who somehow managed to hold the
wealth of his honest affections in her small, highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
manicured hands, and in whom he fancied all possible
happiness was embodied “forever” (as he would
have put it).</p>

<p>The end of it all was Mamma’s ultimatum, strongly
backed up by Ethel’s dutiful acquiescence, to the
effect that a suitable maid must be secured; a person
who would combine in one the capabilities of cook,
ladies’ maid, seamstress, and nurse, and who would
accompany the timid bride on her long journey away
from Mamma’s side.</p>

<p>Imagine, then, the bridegroom’s dilemma, and his
anxiety to secure the advertising young person, who
upon further inquiry promised so exactly to fill the
conditions of his happiness.</p>

<p>These persons, therefore, or their representatives
foregathered at the Preston farm on the morning
of the eighteenth of May. With them also appeared
a half dozen or so of neighbors, curious and prying,
and the usual complement of shabby individuals,
mysteriously aware of the unusual, and always to be
seen at village weddings, funerals, and public auctions.</p>

<p>Thomas Bellows, alert, business-like, came early in
the morning.</p>

<p>“Say, if you want to back out even now,” he said
to Barbara, “I c’n tell th’ folks th’ auction’s off.
I guess you’re feelin’ kind of frightened an’ sorry
you was so rash, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Barbara composedly. “I am not&mdash;frightened
or sorry.” But her face was unnaturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
white, and her eyes, deeply circled with shadowy blue,
belied the statement. “Must I&mdash;stand up and be&mdash;sold,
like&mdash;like&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am!” exclaimed Mr. Bellows decidedly.
“Not by a jugful! You’ve heard from some of the
folks interested, you said?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Barbara, “I’ve had a number of letters.
Two women are looking for a girl to do all
their housework; one needs a nursery governess&mdash;she
is going with her family to South America to
stay five years; another requires a reliable person
to look after an imbecile child.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” exploded Mr. Bellows, “that all?”</p>

<p>By way of answer Barbara produced the letter of
the elderly man who required a competent housekeeper,
and that of the widower, the engineer,
and the type-written communication of the person
who promised a luxurious home in exchange
for “slight occasional services of a sort easily
rendered.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” commented Mr. Bellows, after a deliberate
perusal of these epistles. “Did you tell ’em all
to show up to-day?”</p>

<p>He looked sharply at the girl, as he tapped the
rustling sheets with a blunt, tobacco-stained forefinger.
“The sale ’ll have to be made conditional on
satisfactory evidence that the highest bidder is an
honest, respectable sort of person.</p>

<p>“The’s folks,” he added darkly, “‘at I wouldn’t
sell a cat to&mdash;if I cared shucks ’bout the cat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m not afraid,” said Barbara, “to do any sort
of work.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe not,” Mr. Bellows acquiesced dryly.
“Wall, guess I’ll wait till I git a good look int’ their
faces. I’ll bet,” he added, “‘at I c’n size ’em up all
right. An’ I’ll see t’ it ’at the right bidder gits the
goods. An’ now I’ll tell you what to do. You set
here inside the parlor, same’s if you was the corpse,
we’ll say, at a funeral, an’ I’ll let the bidders come in
one b’ one an’ kind o’ size you up. ’Course they’ve
got to know the general specifications, an’ mebbe
they’ll want to ask a few questions. But you’d best
let me talk up the article like I know how. That’s
m’ business; an’ I won’t make no fool mistakes.”</p>

<p>Barbara drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>“What,” she faltered, “are you going to say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t have to worry none ’bout what I’ll
say. I’ll crack you up sky-high same’s I would a first-class
horse. All you’ve got to do is to set right still
an’ let me do th’ auctioneerin’. I’ll run you up to
fifteen hunderd, if I kin.”</p>

<p>“Tell them I&mdash;I’ll work&mdash;hard and faithfully,”
faltered Barbara.</p>

<p>She choked a little over the last word, her eyes
bright with unshed tears.</p>

<p>“If I was you, ma’am, I’d put on a red ribbon or&mdash;or
somethin’ cheerful-lookin’,” advised Mr. Bellows,
with awkward sympathy. “I like a good bright red
m’self. An’ say, don’t you worry none. You ain’t
’bliged to accept anybody’s bid, unless you feel like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
it. I’m goin’ t’ bid ye in m’self, if things don’t go
right. Where’s the little boy?” he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>Barbara controlled herself with an effort.</p>

<p>“In school,” she replied briefly. “He&mdash;Jimmy
isn’t to know, till&mdash;till afterward.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe you c’n take him along,” hazarded Mr.
Bellows, “to&mdash;South America, say, or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I shall leave him here,” Barbara told him with
stony calm. “I have arranged everything.”</p>

<p>A stamping of feet on the porch brought a defiant
light to the girl’s eyes and a scarlet flush to her
cheeks; Mr. Bellows surveyed her with open satisfaction.</p>

<p>“That’s right!” he encouraged her. “Perk right
up! You look wo’th th’ money now all right. I’ll
open the front door and let the folks pass right in.
Ye don’t need to do a thing but set right still an’ let
me manage things. Biddin’ ’ll begin at ten-thirty,
sharp!”</p>

<p>And he bustled away full of importance.</p>

<p>Barbara stood quite still in the spot where he had
left her, her eyes fastened with a kind of fascinated
terror upon the groups of persons coming toward the
house. The day was bright and warm and the clumps
of old-fashioned shrubs on either side of the driveway,
lilac and bridal wreath and snowball, were in full
bloom. On the other side of the fence long lines of
apple trees laden with odorous pink and white bloom,
lifted their gnarled limbs to the blue sky. Barbara
saw a woman pointing out the trees to the man at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
side. She knew the woman, and fancied she might
be speaking of the great yield of fruit to be expected
that year from the once famous Preston orchards.</p>

<p>For two years past the girl had been toiling to
bring the trees back to a thrifty condition; this
spring for the first time they promised heavy returns
for all her labors.</p>

<p>She clenched her strong brown hands in a passion
of unavailing protest against the cruel fate which
flaunted the myriads of blossoms in her face to-day.</p>

<p>More people were coming than she had expected.
Her face burned with shame at sight of the two
shabby hired hacks among the groups of pedestrians.
A woman in one of them thrust her head out of the
window and asked some questions of the driver. He
nodded his head and presently drew up in front of
the house.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare,” she heard in a high-pitched
feminine voice, “this seems like quite a nice place.
I thought&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The buzzing of tongues in the rooms across the
narrow hall increased; the people were congregating
there. She could hear the occasional sound of Mr.
Bellows’ creaking boots and his loud authoritative
voice, as he answered questions and arranged the
chairs, which two of the shabby men under his direction
were bringing from various parts of the house.</p>

<p>There was something dreadfully suggestive of a
funeral in the subdued hum of voices, the solemnly
inquisitive glances levelled towards the house, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
active, creaking steps of Mr. Bellows. Alone in the
dim old parlor, peering through the shutters, alternately
cold with apprehension and hot with shame,
Barbara found herself threatened with hysterical
laughter. They will come in presently and look at
me, she thought, and stiffened into instant rigidity
at sound of the creaking knob.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” she heard the old auctioneer saying.
“You’ll find the young woman right in here. She’s
ready t’ be interviewed, an’ I’ll guarantee she’s wo’th
double the price anybody’ll bid for her. One at a
time, if you please. An’ five minutes only allowed.”</p>

<p>The door opened, and a tall, showily dressed
woman entered. She stared at Barbara through a
lorgnette.</p>

<p>“Are you the young woman who is to be sold at
auction?” she asked, in an unbelieving voice. “I am
Mrs. Perkins, the housekeeper at Clifton Grange. I
wrote you, with reference to a boy of six. He is large
of his age, and not easy to care for. But his mother,
who is an invalid, won’t hear to his being sent away
from home. Yes; I received your references. But
you don’t look old enough to attempt the position I
speak of. But I shall have to bid, I suppose, for
we can’t keep a nurse in the house. They simply will
not stay through more than one of his fractious
spells. And of course, if we buy you, you’ll be
obliged to remain. Are you strong in your hands?”</p>

<p>“Yes, very,” said Barbara, conscious of the increasing
dryness of her lips and throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“You have rather a nice face,” observed the
woman dubiously. “And I do hope you’re naturally
lively and cheerful; you’ll get along better with <i>him</i>
if you are. If he takes a notion to you, he’ll be
pretty good most of the time. But if he don’t&mdash;&mdash; Are
you used to children?”</p>

<p>“I have a brother.”</p>

<p>“How old?”</p>

<p>“Six years.”</p>

<p>“Well, I declare! Quite a coincidence. Is your
brother an ordinary child?”</p>

<p>“He is perfectly normal, if that is what you
mean,” Barbara managed to say. It was being
harder than she thought.</p>

<p>“One thing more,” the woman was saying. “You
didn’t answer one question I asked. How did you
ever come to think of doing anything so strange as
selling your services at auction? And why should
you demand all the money at once? If your references&mdash;your
pastor’s letter and others&mdash;hadn’t been
so satisfactory, we shouldn’t have thought of considering
you. But we do want to secure someone who
will stay, and of course you’ll be obliged to; though
I’m not allowed to bid above a certain sum. Now
I shall expect a truthful answer to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Bellows obtruded his puckered face into the
room.</p>

<p>“Time’s up, ma’am,” he said authoritatively.
“Other bidders waitin’ their opportunity.”</p>

<p>Barbara could not afterward recall all that passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
during the intolerable period before the bidding began.
She was vaguely aware of women, tall and
short, curious, eager, clutching hand-bags, presumably
containing large sums of money. There were
men, too. The representative of the Boston widower,
the young mining engineer, more eager and determined
than ever after his short interview with Barbara.</p>

<p>“I’ll bid every cent I can on you,” he assured the
girl, with boyish sincerity. “You’re just the one for
us, and I know you’d enjoy the life out there. We
wouldn’t treat you like an ordinary servant; you’d
be more like a friend, I can see that, and I’m sure
Ethel&mdash;Mrs. Selfridge [he blushed at his own delightful
mendacity] will like you very much. She’ll
want to see you at once, if I am the lucky winner.”</p>

<p>It was all strange, dream-like, and for the most
part intolerable. Barbara raised her heavy eyes once
more at the sound of the hard-shut door. Stephen
Jarvis stood looking at her in silence. She felt rather
than saw that some great though subtle change had
come over him.</p>

<p>“Why,” he asked in a voice as changed as his
looks, “have you done this thing?”</p>

<p>She did not answer, and he drew a step nearer.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he said under his breath, “will you give
it up? if I&mdash;agree to all that you asked for&mdash;time
to meet the payments?”</p>

<p>He hesitated as if choosing his words with care.</p>

<p>“You were right about the orchards,” he went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
on. “There will be a good yield&mdash;more than
enough.” He stretched out his hands imploringly,
“Spare me, Barbara,” he entreated. “Don’t put
yourself and me to shame before them all!”</p>

<p>The door swung open a little way.</p>

<p>“Did you say the young woman was in here?”
inquired a feminine voice, sharp with curiosity. Barbara
caught a momentary glimpse of a militant-looking
turban glittering with jet beads. Jarvis shut
the door, and stood against it, a tall sombre figure
of authority.</p>

<p>“Let me put a stop to it all, Barbara,” he urged.
“Barbara!&mdash;in God’s name! I can’t let you do it!”</p>

<p>“It is&mdash;too late,” she said, speaking slowly because
of the dryness of her throat and mouth.
“Don’t you see&mdash;I must go on with it, and I&mdash;shall
pay you&mdash;every cent!”</p>

<p>He drew a difficult breath that was almost a sob.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;will&mdash;pay&mdash;me,” he repeated, a dreadful
self-loathing struggling with the despair in his eyes.
Then he went away, quietly, as he had come.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XI</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">Peg Morrison</span> smote the rough brown backs of his
horses with a practised slap of the lines.</p>

<p>“Y’ remind me o’ the sect in gen’ral,” he observed,
in a loud, critical voice, as the off member of the team
backed and fidgeted uneasily. “When y’ want a
female, woman er hoss, to go, thet’s th’ pertickler
time they elect t’ stan’ still, an’ when y’ want ’em to
stan ’still&mdash;&mdash; Whoa, thar; can’t ye?”</p>

<p>Mr. Morrison paused to wipe the moisture from
his brow with an ancient handkerchief of red and
white, while he gazed lovingly at the wide expanse
of glistening brown earth which had been deeply
ploughed, and more or less levelled into smoothness
under the action of the harrow which the horses were
dragging.</p>

<p>“Planted t’ onions,” he went on, still addressing
his observations to the horses, whose heads drooped
sleepily toward the fresh-smelling ground, “this ’ere
ten acres ’ll net, anyway you figger it, four hunderd
an’ fifty dollars t’ the acre; an’ that’ll total&mdash;l’me
see, somethin’ like&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Morrison’s gaze being wholly introspective
at this stage of the mental problem under consideration,
he failed to notice the man who came swinging
along the road at a smart rate of speed. At sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of the old man leaning meditatively against the fence,
a spent dandelion stalk in his mouth, the pedestrian
halted.</p>

<p>“Why, hello, Peg!” he called out in a clear and
somewhat authoritative voice.</p>

<p>The stranger wore a rough suit of weather-stained
tweeds; and his felt hat, set at a becoming angle on
his curly head, shaded a face bronzed by sun and
wind almost to the color of the full brown beard
curling away from his red mouth with a careless
boldness repeated in the humorous blue eyes which
roved over the shabby old figure by the fence.</p>

<p>He laughed outright at the puzzled look in Morrison’s
face.</p>

<p>Then he folded his arms on top of the fence.</p>

<p>“Well, how goes it, old man?” he inquired.
“Same lazy old horses&mdash;eh? Same job, same season
of the year, same old clothes, I should say&mdash;even
to the red and white bandanna. Makes me feel as if
I’d been dreaming. Maybe I have; who knows?”</p>

<p>“Who be ye?” demanded Peg. “Seems ’s ’o I’d
seen ye somewhars; but I can’t think whar.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be hasty, my friend,” advised the other,
pulling his hat over his laughing eyes. “You’ve
forgotten me, and so, apparently, has everyone else.
I saw Al Hewett at the station and he told me Miss
Preston was unmarried and still at home, and that
old Don Preston had gone to his reward a couple of
years ago.”</p>

<p>“I c’n see you used t’ live ’round here,” hazarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Peg, shaking his head, “but I can’t seem t’ rec’lect
who ye be; ’nless&mdash;&mdash; If I didn’t know he was dead
I might think you was the young feller ’at used t’
teach school in th’ village. Whitcomb, his name was.
But he’s been dead a matter o’ three years.”</p>

<p>“That being the case,” said the stranger coolly,
“perhaps you’ll tell me about the auction up at the
farm. I heard some women asking questions about
it at the station.”</p>

<p>“Auction?” repeated Peg. “The’ ain’t no auction
at our place&mdash;not yet. But you sure do remind
me o’ that young school-teacher feller. He got gold
crazy, an’ went off&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know; and got lost on a trail and froze
to death,” interrupted the stranger. “So I heard.
Sad, wasn’t it? Did they find the body?”</p>

<p>“Not,” said Peg, his puzzled eyes still searching
the stranger’s face, “as I heerd tell of.”</p>

<p>“Then you think the coast is clear up at the
farm? Is Barbara&mdash;Miss Preston&mdash;at home?”</p>

<p>“Miss Barb’ry was to home when I come away at
six-thirty this mornin’. Say, are you&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“I’ll walk over and call on her,” interrupted the
young man, with some impatience. “Perhaps Barbara
will remember an old friend. Her eyes used to
be bright enough.”</p>

<p>Peg unhitched the harrow with fine deliberation.</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute,” he requested, “an’ I’ll step
’long with ye. It’s gittin’ ’long towards noon, anyhow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>He was furtively studying the younger man’s face
and figure, as he let down the bars and drove his
horses through.</p>

<p>“B’en doin’ any school-teachin’ sence ye left these
parts?” he drawled, as the two struck the road at a
pace commensurate to the unhurried gait of the old
horses.</p>

<p>“No,” said the stranger. He plunged his hands
deep in his pockets, the merriment suddenly gone
from his face and eyes.</p>

<p>“Ye look consid’ble older’n ye did,” observed Peg
mildly, “an’ the whiskers gives ye a diff’rent look;
but come t’ take notice, most anybody’d know ye,
though ye must hev knocked ’round consid’able. Hev
any luck minin’?”</p>

<p>Whitcomb laughed, throwing back his head as if
the question afforded him a vast deal of amusement.</p>

<p>“Luck?” he echoed. “Certainly; a man’s bound
to strike luck of one sort or another.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fac’,” agreed Peg sententiously, “an’
you can’t most always sometimes tell one sort f’om
the other. What passes fer the worst sort o’ luck ’ll
frequent turn out to be fust-rate. I knew a man
once&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped short, his jaw dropping at sight of
the numerous vehicles congregated near the house
which they were approaching. “I swan!” he ejaculated.
“It sure does look like&mdash;&mdash; But Miss Barb’ry
never said nothin’ t’ me. She never tol’ me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m going in,” said David Whitcomb, scowling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Several women congregated near the door stared at
him with a resentful air as he made his way masterfully
among them.</p>

<p>At one end of the long, low room, his back to the
open windows, stood Thomas Bellows, a small bare
table in front of him, on which he rested the flat
of his outspread hands while haranguing the company
ranged on either side, the women for the most part
comfortably seated, the men standing in the rear, as
if half ashamed to be present.</p>

<p>“Eight hunderd, do I hear?” inquired the auctioneer
in a tone of passionate protest, “it bein’
understood there’ll be a five years’ lease on the prop’ty
in question? Ladies an’ gents, that ain’t right!
Eight hunderd ain’t a patch on what she’s worth.
I’ve told you what sort of goods you’re biddin’ on
an’ you’ve had the opportunity to see fer yourselves.
Eight hunderd ten, do I hear? Who’ll make it a
fifty? Eight hunderd fifty; who’ll make it nine hunderd?
Come! let me hear some good lively biddin’
on the part of the lady in the green dress. This lady
is lookin’ fer an honest, permanent hired girl; she
told me so b’fore the biddin’ begun. She’s had a
terrible time with hired help; she’s paid ’em high
wages, an’ they break her china dishes, steal her
clo’es, an&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“That’s right! eight hunderd sixty-five from the
young man in the comer. That gentleman knows
what’s what; an’ he’s lookin’ fer an A number one
helper t’ take west t’ help his wife do the cookin’.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
W’y, this is the opportunity of a lifetime, an’ if you
let it pass&mdash;eight hunderd seventy dollars I’m offered,
who’ll make it nine hunderd? I’ll tell ye, straight,
ladies, this perfec’ly healthy, honest, willin’, agreeable,
faithful young woman ain’t goin’t’ be knocked
down t’ any of ye at nine hunderd dollars. Don’t
think it fer a minute! She’s goin’ to git her price, an’
I know what it is.”</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, what’s going on here?” asked
Whitcomb of a man in a fashionable light suit, with
a diamond in his shirt-front. “What is the man
selling?”</p>

<p>By way of answer the man held up his two hands,
the fingers outstretched.</p>

<p>“There you are, ten hunderd dollars I’m offered;
one thousand dollars! Who’ll make it eleven? A
thousand dollars may sound like a pretty good sum
t’ slap down all at once, ladies; but do a little figurin’,
if you please! You pay eighteen, twenty, twenty-five
dollars a month for a raw, untrained foreigner; can’t
speak English, can’t cook, can’t do nothin’, an’ once
you get her trained off she goes’s lively’s a flea. Five
years of domestic peace in yer home! Five years of
perfec’ happiness! Ain’t it worth more’n a measly
thousand dollars? The gentleman in the comer says
it is; he bids ten hunderd fifty. Ten hunderd fifty,
ten hunderd sixty! Oh, come, let’s run ’er up faster!
I can’t stan’ here all day foolin’. The gentleman in
the corner again. Yes, sir, eleven hunderd! Who’ll
make it twelve?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“Stop long enough to tell me what you’re selling,
man,” called the latest comer, in a loud, clear voice.
“I didn’t get here in time to find out, and no one will
tell me.”</p>

<p>A general murmur of protest arose all over the
room. A tall woman, with a high-peaked nose set
midway in a large expanse of purplish-red face,
arose.</p>

<p>“I’m through!” she announced acidly. “Let me
out of here.”</p>

<p>“No, you ain’t, ma’am. Kindly set down in that
nice comf’table cheer you’ve been occupyin’ fer about
ten minutes longer. I’ll answer this gentleman quick
an’t’ the p’int an’ we’ll go on with the biddin’. I’m
auctionin’ off five years o’ faithful work an’ service;
I’m auctionin’ peace an’ happiness in the home; I’m
auctionin’ the educated brains an’ han’s an’ feet of
the smartest young lady in this ’ere United States of
Ameriky! An’ that’s Miss Barbara Preston. Do
you want to bid? Eleven hunderd dollars I’m offered;
who’ll make it twelve?”</p>

<p>“It’s an outrage on civilization!” cried the man
who had interrupted. “I protest against the sale!”</p>

<p>“Put him out! Put him out!” shouted a dozen
voices.</p>

<p>In the midst of the tumult some one signalled twelve
hundred, and Thomas Bellows caught the figures.
Pounding on the table with his mallet, he commanded
order.</p>

<p>“The sale will be continued, and I’m offered twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
hunderd dollars; remember, gentlemen; remember,
ladies, your bids will be cancelled if you do not live
up to your part of the previous agreement. Spot
cash before you leave the room, and a guarantee of
honorable service and kind treatment. Gentlemen!
Ladies! Your attention, please! Twelve hunderd
dollars I’m offered! Twelve hunderd, going! Twelve
hunderd dollars! Twelve hunderd, fifty? Yes, sir!
Twelve hunderd, sixty! Thirteen hunderd dollars I’m
bid by the gentleman by the door. Come down front
where we can all see you, sir. Thirteen hunderd,
going!&mdash;Fourteen hunderd! Now this is something
like! Isn’t there any lady present who’ll make it
fifteen?”</p>

<p>The woman in the green dress rose in her place.</p>

<p>“This is preposterous!” she cried. “No servant
is worth&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Be quiet, madam,” commanded the auctioneer.
“I’m runnin’ this sale. Fourteen hunderd dollars.
Is there any lady or gent in the room who’ll raise it?
Fourteen hunderd fifty. Fifteen hunderd!”</p>

<p>“Sixteen hundred!”</p>

<p>The young man in the travel-stained tweeds shook
his fist in the face of the small, seedy man, who
drawled out his bids in a hoarse, scarcely audible
voice.</p>

<p>“Sixteen hunderd I’m offered by the gentleman who
has just arrived. Sixteen hunderd, going!”</p>

<p>“Two thousand!” piped the little man in the
creased checked suit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“Twenty-one hundred!” shouted the latest comer,
his eyes blazing.</p>

<p>“Twenty-three hundred!” said the engineer in a
dogged monotone.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five hundred!” wheezed the man in
checks, squinting through his glasses at the paper
on which he was setting down the bids with painstaking
neatness.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five hunderd dollars I’m offered!”
shrilled the auctioneer. “Do you raise it?” He
turned to Whitcomb.</p>

<p>“Twenty-six hundred!” cried the engineer excitedly.</p>

<p>“Three thousand!” the hoarse voice of the shabby
little stranger interposed.</p>

<p>“Three thousand, one hundred!” snapped Whitcomb.</p>

<p>“Three thousand one hunderd! Who’ll make it
four thousand?” The old auctioneer’s voice trembled.
He leaned far out over the table, brandishing
his mallet wildly.</p>

<p>The man in the checked suit nodded.</p>

<p>“Four thousand dollars I’m bid; who’ll raise it to
five?”</p>

<p>The young fellow who had tacitly acknowledged
himself to be David Whitcomb groaned aloud.</p>

<p>“I can’t do it!” he said.</p>

<p>There was a general stir and turning of heads as
Peg Morrison forced his way through the excited
crowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hold on thar!” he cried, in a loud, tremulous
voice. “I’ve been up an’ got my money an’ counted
it. I’ll bid on Miss Barb’ry myself. She ain’t a-goin’
t’ leave this ’ere farm t’ go with nobody, ’f I c’n help
it! I bid fifty-eight dollars an’ sixty-five cents on
Miss Barb’ry, an’ it’s all I’ve got in the world!”</p>

<p>“Four thousand dollars I’m bid!” cried Mr. Bellows,
his professional tones easily dominating the
babel of voices. “Four thousand dollars, going!
Four thousand dollars, going! Four thousand dollars,
gone! And sold to this ’ere gentleman. Your
name, please!”</p>

<p>The small man, in the checked clothes, cleared his
throat weakly and blinked, as he strapped the leathern
memorandum book.</p>

<p>“My name’s Smith,” he said, in an apologetic
whisper.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Smith, you c’n settle right here and
now, an’ I’ll give you a signed receipt.”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” blustered Whitcomb, his face flushed
to a wrathful crimson. “Who is this fellow, and
what does he mean to do with&mdash;Barbara?” The
last word was a groan of rage and disappointment.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir; I’ve got a bad cold an’ can’t
talk. I’ll explain to Mr. Bellows here in private.
Yes, sir; I’ve got the money all right.”</p>

<p>The woman in the jetted turban and the tall lady
in green advanced in a determined way, backed up by
three women of the village, burning with neighborly
zeal; the countenances of all five expressed blended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
curiosity and disapproval. The small man in the
checked suit endeavored to shrink behind Mr. Bellows’
portly person, but the lady in the jetted turban fixed
him with her glittering eye.</p>

<p>“I command you to tell me at once why you bid
four thousand dollars for the services of the young
person in the other room,” said this person in a militant
voice. “I suspect your motives, sir! I doubt
your respectability.” She turned to the other
women. “Tell me,” she demanded, “does this man
look honest?”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith blinked weakly at his inquisitors.</p>

<p>“I’m all right, ma’am,” he said hoarsely, “an’
puffec’ly honest. An’ I ain’t biddin’ for myself, but
for another party.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed!” exclaimed the five women in unbelieving
chorus. “Who is your principal?” snapped
the indignant lady in green. “Of course we all know
the girl can’t be worth eight hundred dollars a year,
in any respectable employment.”</p>

<p>The little man coughed apologetically.</p>

<p>“She’s wanted,” he said, “by a responsible party
to look after a little boy&mdash;a very nice, respectable
little boy.”</p>

<p>“Is he a widower?” shrieked the ladies in unison.</p>

<p>“No, ma’am,” replied the little man, ducking his
head fearfully and edging away. “He ain’t old
enough to be married yet.”</p>

<p>“Not old enough to be married? Oh! you mean
the boy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come on, sir, an’ we’ll settle,” put in the auctioneer,
taking Mr. Smith by the arm, as if he feared
he might be planning an escape.</p>

<p>But Mr. Smith appeared entirely ready, even
anxious, to settle. In the privacy of the kitchen he
counted off from a sizable roll four thousand dollars
in bills of large denominations, repeating in a painstaking
manner what he had already told the women.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; the young woman’s wanted to look after
a child.”</p>

<p>“Whereabouts?” inquired the auctioneer.</p>

<p>“W’y, I don’t rightly know,” wheezed Mr. Smith.
“M’ asthma’s terrible bad this morning.”</p>

<p>“So I see! so I see,” observed Mr. Bellows, rubbing
his chin dubiously. “An’ you can’t tell me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The young woman is to stay right here till she’s
called for,” repeated the gentleman in checks. “No,
sir; I couldn’t say when that ’ll be. She must be
ready to start most any day. But she’s to stay right
here till called for. You tell her. Yes, sir. I’ve got
references. Everythin’ O.K. Tell her that, will you?
An’, say, you’ll pass the money right over to her, will
you? To-day; yes.”</p>

<p>“Less fi’ per cent,” said Mr. Bellows unctuously.
“Pretty good mornin’s work,” he added, rubbing
his hands. “I never thought o’ such a thing’s runnin’
her up to such a figure. An’ you’d ’a’ bid more, I
take it, if you’d had to? As ’twas, you was kind of
reckless towards the last.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe I did go a little higher’n I needed to,” acknowledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Mr. Smith mildly. “But I thought I
might as well.” He coughed and blinked weakly.
“It didn’t make no difference to me,” he said. “I
wuz prepared to secure the services of the young
woman at any figure. Yes, sir.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">XII</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">“I congratulate</span> ye, ma’am, on the success o’ your
idee,” Thomas Bellows said, when an hour later he
handed to Barbara the roll of bills from which he
had complacently peeled off his own tidy commission.
“This ’ere ’ll pay off the lien on your prop’ty, I take
it, an’ leave you a pretty good nest-egg besides.”</p>

<p>“Who,” said Barbara, her face pale and troubled,
“bought&mdash;me?”</p>

<p>“W’y, as t’ that,” confessed the auctioneer, “I
can’t tell you exactly. I was asked to hand you this
’ere letter. It contains further perticklers, I persoom.”</p>

<p>He produced a thick square envelope bearing her
name and address in type-written characters.</p>

<p>“You was to stay right here on call, I was asked
t’ inform you. No, ma’am; it wa’n’t any o’ them
folks that wrote t’ you beforehand. A man, name of
Smith; said he was the agent of the party as bid
you in. You’re to stay right here till called for.”</p>

<p>Barbara had opened the envelope and was scanning
the few lines of type-writing in the middle of the
large square sheet.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Miss Barbara Preston [she read] will hold herself in readiness
to enter upon the term of her service, previously understood to
be five years. It is impossible, at the present instant, for the
writer to state when the call will come; but the term of service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
will be reckoned from this eighteenth day of May, 19&mdash;&mdash;. Miss
Preston’s duties will comprise the conduct of a home, and the
care and guardianship of a little child.”</p>

<p class="p1">There was also enclosed a stamped and addressed
envelope, containing a paper drawn up in legal form,
binding one Barbara Preston, spinster, for and in
consideration of the sum of four thousand dollars
(herein acknowledged), to a term of continuous service,
beginning on the eighteenth day of May, 19&mdash;
and terminating on the same day of the month
in the year 19&mdash;. The document was duly witnessed
and bore, in lieu of signature, the imprint of a seal,
with a device of crossed battle-axes and the single
word <i>Invictus</i>.</p>

<p>“You’re t’ sign right here,” said Mr. Bellows, indicating
with his blunt forefinger the space below the
seal. “Me an’ Peg Morrison ’ll witness the signature.
I told him to wait outside, in case the’ was
papers to sign. I’ll see to forwardin’ it for you. Le’
me see that there envelope; likely it’ll shed a little
light on th’ identity o’ the party.”</p>

<p>But the envelope bore merely the number of a
post-office box, in a distant city.</p>

<p>Mr. Bellows scratched his head and squinted his
eyes into puzzled slits as he surveyed this unsatisfactory
bit of evidence from every possible
angle.</p>

<p>“Wall, I don’t know,” he burst out at length,
“es I’d trust that proposition teetotally, if it wasn’t
fer the references. The man as bid ye in satisfied me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the party he was representin’ was O.K. es t’ character
an’ intentions.”</p>

<p>He glanced shrewdly at the girl; but Barbara
asked no questions. She was beginning to realize
that while the shackles which had bound her to Jarvis
were about to be loosed, this unknown master of her
future had forged a new and perhaps heavier fetter.
But her composed features betrayed nothing while
she wrote her name clearly&mdash;Barbara Allen Preston&mdash;below
the red seal, with its short but significant
motto.</p>

<p>Thomas Bellows went away after a little, taking
with him the contract, duly signed, sealed, and ready
to deliver, and Barbara, left quite alone in the disordered
house, quietly locked the money away in a
drawer of her desk.</p>

<p>She turned to find Peg Morrison staring at her
with eyes full of grief and consternation.</p>

<p>“Miss Barb’ry,” he began, “why in creation
didn’t ye tell me what you was goin’ t’ do? Sellin’
yourself&mdash;sellin’ your own flesh an’ blood, like you
was an Aferc’n slave! What d’you s’pose your folks
’d a said t’ what took place in this ’ere house t’-day&mdash;huh?
I’ll bet your grandmother Preston ’d think
you’d gone crazy. Where be you goin’? What you
goin’ t’ do with th’ Cap’n? Whar do I come in in this
’ere deal? Them’s questions ’at I want answered
right now. I’ve a notion,” he added darkly, “that
you be kind o’ cracked. ’N’ I don’t wonder at it
much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Barbara was putting the furniture in place,
straightening the rugs, and otherwise restoring to
its wonted order the scene of the recent auction.
Her cheeks and lips were bright with color; her eyes
sparkled as she faced the old man.</p>

<p>“You are entirely mistaken, Peg,” she said impatiently.
“Just listen, will you? If I had waited
a few days longer we should have been sold out under
the hammer&mdash;farm, house, furniture, stock. Now we
shan’t be. Do you understand? This very day I’m
going to settle with the Honorable Stephen Jarvis
[her red lips curled a little over the words], and I’ll
pay Abe Hewett, too, and all the others. Oh! I’m
glad I did it&mdash;glad! Jimmy will have the farm, and
there’ll be plenty left to fix the fences, and buy the
fertilizers we need and mend the broken roof and
maybe paint the house. Don’t you see, Peg, what a
splendid thing it will be?”</p>

<p>“But where are you goin’, Miss Barb-ry?” The
old man’s voice held the sound of tears. “An’ who’s
goin’ to take care o’ the Cap’n?”</p>

<p>Barbara compressed her lips sternly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know where I shall go,” she said, “but
wherever I am I can write to&mdash;to Jimmy; and Peg,
I want you to stay, just as you have; only I shall
pay you good wages. I shall pay up all that I owe
you, too, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Will I hev charge o’ the Cap’n?” inquired
the old man anxiously. “Five years is a long
time, Miss Barb’ry, he’ll be&mdash;l’ me see. W’y,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the Cap’n ’ll be ’leven years old time you’re at
liberty.”</p>

<p>Barbara drew her fine dark brows together.</p>

<p>“I’ve engaged Martha Cottle to come here and
keep house and take care of Jimmy,” she said.
“She’s coming this afternoon.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morrison’s jaw dropped.</p>

<p>“Marthy Cottle!” he ejaculated. “W’y, that
female&mdash;she don’t know no more ’bout little boys
’an&mdash;’an a Holstein steer. She’s an old maid schoolmarm,
cut an’ dried.”</p>

<p>“She can help Jimmy with his lessons,” Barbara
said doggedly. “She’s good and honest, and she’ll
do her best to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Gosh!” murmured the old man, shaking his head.
“She’ll do her best, mebbe, but&mdash;wall, I’ll do what
I kin fer the Cap’n t’&mdash;keep him f’om gittin’ too
awful lonesome an’ discouraged. Marthy Cottle!
Huh! We’ll hev t’ make out the best we kin after
you’re gone. Does&mdash;the Cap’n know&mdash;hev you tol’
him you’re a-goin leave him?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Barbara, in a harsh voice. “I haven’t,
and I don’t intend to, either. I&mdash;I’ll leave word. I&mdash;couldn’t,
Peg.”</p>

<p>Her young voice broke in an irrepressible sob.</p>

<p>“Don’t you feel bad, Miss Barb’ry,” the old man
essayed to comfort her. “You meant it fer the best,
I know you did, Miss Barb’ry. An’ mebbe it’ll turn
out all right. I wouldn’t cross no bridges till I got
to ’em, ef I was you. I s’pose,” he went on, his shrewd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
eyes on her face, “‘at you seen young Dave Whitcomb
this mornin’&mdash;him ’at used to teach school in
th’ village?”</p>

<p>Barbara’s face whitened.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean&mdash;&mdash;” she faltered.</p>

<p>“Dave was here t’ the auction,” pursued Mr. Morrison.
“I heerd him put in two or three big bids on
ye. He was ready to pass out his entire pile t’&mdash;save
ye f’om bein’ took away; I’ll say that much fer
Dave.”</p>

<p>He turned, with his hand on the door.</p>

<p>“I didn’t hev nothin’ when it come t’ biddin’,” he
groaned. “I might ’a’ saved m’ breath t’ cool m’
porridge. But I’d ’a’ give the best fi’ years off’n
m’ life t’ ’a’ kep’ ye right here at home, where ye
b’long. I swan I would, Miss Barb’ry.”</p>

<p>“I know you would, Peg,” Barbara said gently.
Her eyes, the beautiful clear eyes of her father in his
first unspoiled youth, were misty with tears, but she
smiled bravely. “Five years isn’t long,” she reminded
him. “It’ll soon be over. And you can raise
five crops of those wonderful onions while I’m gone.”</p>

<p>Stephen Jarvis was at home and alone in his library
that afternoon when Barbara asked to see him. It
might even have been inferred that he expected her;
but if he did, he made no sign. His manner was cool
and calm, quite in keeping with the business of the
hour, as he took pains to explain to her a number
of details connected with the accumulated interest
upon interest, delinquent tax accounts, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
matters pertaining to the estate which Barbara, in
her poverty, had been forced to ignore.</p>

<p>“I can pay it all,” she said to him, the fruit of
her triumph sweet upon her lips. “That is why I am
here&mdash;to pay&mdash;everything I owe.”</p>

<p>He looked at her quietly.</p>

<p>“You are doubtless to be congratulated upon the
success of your scheme,” he said. “I hear you realized
quite a handsome sum on the sale of&mdash;&mdash;” he
hesitated for the fraction of a minute&mdash;“your
future.”</p>

<p>“It will be only five years,” Barbara said defiantly.
“I shall be glad to work&mdash;hard, for Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“When,” he asked, “do you expect to leave
town?”</p>

<p>“To-day, to-morrow&mdash;I cannot tell. I am ready
to go now.”</p>

<p>“To be gone five years,” he said thoughtfully.
“Very well; we will finish this business at once. Let
me advise you to attend to your taxes promptly hereafter;
and if&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” interrupted Barbara haughtily. “I
shall be able, I am sure, to meet all obligations in the
future. The farm may be worthless, worn out, but it
will pay for itself.”</p>

<p>He did not appear to have heard her last words.
He was busily arranging various papers. And presently
he handed her the cancelled bond and mortgage,
and the receipted tax bills, all neatly arranged. In
return she counted out to him, with fingers which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
trembled in spite of herself, the crisp bills for which
she had sold her youth.</p>

<p>“There!” she said rather breathlessly. “Is that
all?”</p>

<p>“All,” he repeated quietly. “And it is all quite
right. Thank you.”</p>

<p>She looked at him uncertainly. His head was bent,
his eyes fixed upon the pile of rustling bank-notes
which she had just pushed toward him.</p>

<p>A sudden unreasoning sense of dismay fell upon the
girl, shadowing the triumph in her face. She made
swift retreat toward the door, casting a half-frightened
backward look at the sombre figure behind the
desk.</p>

<p>He did not lift his eyes from their unseeing contemplation
of the money, even when the jarring sound
of the hard-shut door told him she was gone.</p>

<p>Left quite alone Stephen Jarvis slowly folded the
notes, sealed them securely in a stout envelope and
locked them in his safe.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">XIII</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">Young Whitcomb</span> sat quite at his ease in Donald
Preston’s big arm-chair, one leg flung carelessly over
the other, his handsome head thrown back, its riotous
curls shining in the lamp-light. His blue eyes, full of
laughter, were set upon Barbara.</p>

<p>“So you thought I was dead, did you?” he asked,
in a bantering tone; “but it didn’t appear to bother
you much. You’re looking handsomer than ever,
Barbara. I had an idea I’d find you&mdash;changed.”</p>

<p>He waited for some sort of reply; but Barbara
was trying hard to reconcile the ruddy, smiling man,
who sat so unconcernedly in her dead father’s place,
with the pallid, serious, large-eyed phantom of her
dreams. She had been looking at him in puzzled
silence, and now her glance disengaged itself from his
with an effort.</p>

<p>“I’ll wager,” he said, “that you have been thinking
of me with ’a crown upon my forehead, a harp
within my hand,’ the way we used to sing in Sunday
school when we were kids. Now own up! And you’re
disappointed to find that I’m such a commonplace,
live-looking chap&mdash;eh, Barbara?”</p>

<p>“I find you&mdash;changed,” she confessed, in a low
voice, “greatly changed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>David Whitcomb laughed triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Yes; I flatter myself that the pious pedagogue
has been pretty well knocked out of me in the last
five years. Good Lord! what a solemn, sentimental
ass I must have been in those days. It was a lucky
thing for me that you sent me about my business.
Still,&mdash;Barbara, I’d give a gold nugget to know just
what you thought when they told you I’d passed in
my checks. Did you picture poor David lying cold
and pale under some frozen cairn along the Yukon
trail? That’s the way they dispose of unlucky
prospectors up north; just dig a hole in the snow
and drop ’em in; then pile stones on top to keep off
the wolves. Ugh! I can hear ’em howl, if I stop to
to think, now. Did you drop a tear on that imaginary
grave of mine up in the Arctic; did you, Barbara?”</p>

<p>Her eyes evaded his smiling blue gaze.</p>

<p>“Why should you ask?” she hesitated. “It was
a great surprise&mdash;a great shock.”</p>

<p>“You refer, of course, to the news of my death,”
he said. “But you survived the shock, as you call it,
and&mdash;you are far more beautiful than I remembered
you.”</p>

<p>He leaned forward and rested his head on his
clasped hands, his eyes searching her face with smiling
boldness.</p>

<p>“There are not many men,” he went on, “who
come back from the grave the way I did to find&mdash;everything
so unchanged.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>He sprang from his chair and paced the floor excitedly.</p>

<p>“If I’d only come yesterday!” he cried. “I had
saved enough&mdash;I could have prevented that absurd
fiasco.”</p>

<p>He stopped in front of her.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you answer my letter, Barbara?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t read it,” she murmured, a sudden vivid
color fluttering in her cheeks. “Jimmy lost it on
the way home from the office, and it lay out in the
rain a week. I knew, though, that you were not&mdash;dead.”</p>

<p>“And that I had not forgotten you,” he urged.
“You must have wondered, though, why I had not
written before. But I couldn’t. I swore when I
went away that I would get money&mdash;somehow. That
I would get enough to save you out of the slavery
you were in then. I meant to hire a caretaker for
your father, a nurse for the boy. But I had the
devil’s own luck. Three times I won, only to lose.
Then I made a little pile&mdash;not enough; but still I
thought&mdash;I hoped&mdash;&mdash; Do you want me to tell you
what I hoped, Barbara?”</p>

<p>“No,” she said faintly. “I&mdash;can’t listen.”</p>

<p>“Why?” he urged. “Do you&mdash;love someone
else?”</p>

<p>She looked at him imploringly.</p>

<p>“You were here, and you know&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said sharply. “I know what happened.
You must have been out of your mind with anxiety,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Barbara, to have thought of such a thing. Why
did you do it?”</p>

<p>“I wanted to save the farm&mdash;for Jimmy.”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, with a muttered exclamation.</p>

<p>“You got the money?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And so you’re sold into slavery for five years?”</p>

<p>She made no reply.</p>

<p>“Now, see here, Barbara. I won’t stand for
anything of the sort. It’s an outrage. I haven’t
enough&mdash;quite&mdash;to pay the other fellow out; but I’ll
arrange it with him&mdash;or her. Is it a man or a woman
slave-holder, Barbara?”</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;don’t know,” she said, “not yet.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know?” he echoed. “Why, this is
more preposterous than the other. Of course you’ll
have to know.”</p>

<p>“It is quite true,” she said quietly. “I only know
that I must be ready to leave home at a minute’s
notice.”</p>

<p>He bent over her with sudden passion.</p>

<p>“Marry me, Barbara,” he begged in a low, shaken
voice. “If you only will, I’ll manage it somehow.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;can’t,” she murmured. “I am in honor
bound. Don’t you see? I’ve accepted the money,
and paid a part of it for debts.”</p>

<p>He threw himself down in his chair and pulled
it toward hers impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let me think,” he said quickly. “You’ve paid
off your mortgage. How much was it?”</p>

<p>She told him, and he set down the figures rapidly.</p>

<p>“Who held your mortgage?” he wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Stephen Jarvis,” she said, with a singular reluctance
at which she wondered, even while she perceived
it.</p>

<p>“Miserly old crab; I remember him,” said David
Whitcomb.</p>

<p>His face brightened suddenly.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” he cried. “I have it! With what
you’ve got left and my little pile we’ve more than
enough to buy you back. Don’t you see? Marry me,
dear, and we’ll call the sale off, pay back the money,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped short at sight of her unresponsive
face.</p>

<p>“I’ve signed a contract,” she objected.</p>

<p>“What if you have?” he urged. “The contract
can be quashed. You’ll give me the right to get you
out of it, Barbara?”</p>

<p>She hesitated, her eyes averted from his anxious
face.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you don’t&mdash;that you can’t&mdash;?
Barbara, do you prefer slavery&mdash;to me?”</p>

<p>“I mean,” she said slowly, “that I cannot&mdash;promise
you anything until&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But don’t you see, dear, that it would be better,
safer that way? As your husband&mdash;even as your
promised husband&mdash;I could&mdash;Good Lord! what a preposterous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
situation! You must give me the right to
get you out of it.”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“I did it voluntarily,” she said, “and I must
fulfil my agreement.”</p>

<p>His face reddened with quick anger.</p>

<p>“Then you will go peacefully away with this person&mdash;man
or woman&mdash;and stay five years, when the
matter might easily be arranged by paying back the
money, and by proving a prior claim. My claim is
prior, Barbara. I loved you five years ago. I love
you now. Give me the right to break this absurd
bond. Won’t you, Barbara?”</p>

<p>His lips, his eyes, pleaded with his eloquent voice.
He dropped to his knees beside her chair; his arm
stole about her waist.</p>

<p>“Barbara!” he murmured, his face close to hers.</p>

<p>She broke from him with a little shuddering cry.</p>

<p>“What is it? What have I done?”</p>

<p>“Do you know&mdash;did you hear how my father&mdash;died?”
she asked, in a frightened voice.</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet, his face crimson with shame
and fury.</p>

<p>“I drank a glass of wine before I came here to-night&mdash;a
single glass,” he said. “Is it that you
mean?”</p>

<p>His eyes demanded instant answer.</p>

<p>“If you had suffered what I suffered&mdash;&mdash;” she began;
then her voice broke. “I couldn’t help it,
David; I&mdash;remembered.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the first time she had called him by his
name. He looked at her in silence for a minute.</p>

<p>“I understand,” he said gently. “I won’t offend
again. I promise you.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” she went on hurriedly, “I shall
hear; someone will call for me. I am all ready&mdash;to
go. But I will&mdash;try, I will explain&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She put out her hand to forestall his quick
protest.</p>

<p>“No; please. I&mdash;cannot promise anything&mdash;yield
anything, until I have arranged the matter. If I
succeed&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He waited for her to go on.</p>

<p>“I must have time to think,” she murmured. “I&mdash;am
not sure of myself.”</p>

<p>He went away, bidding her a brief good-night, his
eyes hurt and angry.</p>

<p>Barbara watched his straight, lithe figure, as he
strode away from the little circle of her lamp-light
into the dripping gloom of the spring night. So
had she sent him away from her long ago into the
rain and the darkness. Then, as now, she was in
honor bound to a lonely task.</p>

<p>She turned to find her newly engaged housekeeper
standing behind her in the semi-obscurity of the
passage. Martha Cottle was a tall, angular woman
with a pallid, uncertain complexion, a long thin
nose, and an air of perpetual inquiry.</p>

<p>“Was that the party you expect to work for?”
she demanded. “I thought,” she added, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
slightly offended air, “that you’d call me in and introduce
me. I was waiting in the dining-room.”</p>

<p>Barbara wondered if the spinster’s large, flat ears
had caught any of the conversation, carried on unguardedly
on the other side of the door.</p>

<p>She shook her head. “That wasn’t the person,”
she said. “Perhaps to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;” She hesitated.
“Of course it will be soon.”</p>

<p>Miss Cottle pushed authoritatively into the room
where Barbara had been sitting.</p>

<p>“I haven’t had a real good opportunity to talk
things over with you,” she said. “If you’re expecting
to be called away sudden, perhaps this will be as good
a time as any. I want to tell you what I think about
that child.”</p>

<p>Barbara drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>“Well?” she murmured interrogatively.</p>

<p>“I see you’ve spoiled him pretty completely,” pursued
Miss Cottle. “But I’ll soon get him in
hand.”</p>

<p>She compressed her thin lips.</p>

<p>“He got into a regular tantrum to-night because
I took a book of his to look at. ‘Vallable Inf’mation,’
he calls it. Nearly every word in it is spelled
wrong. I wonder at you for permitting anything of
the sort. I took the book away from him. Here it
is.”</p>

<p>Barbara looked at the woman in a sudden panic
of apprehension.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she protested, “you ought not to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
done that. The book was a birthday present. It
is one of Jimmy’s dearest treasures.”</p>

<p>“I believe you said you wanted I should look after
James’s education,” intoned the spinster. “If I am
to stay here, I shall do it con-sci-en-tiously.”</p>

<p>She pronounced the last word with due regard to
every syllable, it being a favorite adverb modifying
every possible activity.</p>

<p>Barbara was turning over the pages of the book,
several of which were quite covered with Jimmy’s
scrawling characters in red ink.</p>

<p>“A Vallable Information ’bout getting mad [she
read]. Dont get mad Ezy. It dont Do enny Good,
an sum the tim it gets a fello in Trubble. Peg says
this is portant.”</p>

<p>Barbara smiled as she shut the covers gently together.</p>

<p>“I shall give this book to Jimmy,” she said quietly,
“and please, Miss Cottle, don’t take it away from
him again. Jimmy is such a little boy, and I&mdash;he has
always been loved. I hope you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in sozzling over a child,” interrupted
the woman severely. “I’ll see that the boy
gets plenty of good bread and butter, and that he
goes to school and Sabbath services regularly. By
the time you get back I guess you’ll see quite a change
in him. When do you expect to start, to-morrow?”</p>

<p>Miss Cottle’s tone expressed a growing impatience.</p>

<p>“I supposed you’d get off this afternoon. I see
your trunk is packed and all. There’s no use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
hanging back and procrastinating when there’s work
to do. That’s one thing I shall teach James.”</p>

<p>She compressed her lips severely, as if anxious to
begin.</p>

<p>“I am ready to go,” Barbara told her, with lips
which trembled in spite of herself. “I hope you won’t
be too severe with Jimmy&mdash;at first; he isn’t used to
it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Miss Cottle, with an acid smile,
“it’s easy enough to see that you’ve spoiled the child
completely. But I’ll soon straighten him out. My
method with children has never been known to fail.
Their wills want breaking the first thing; after that
they’ll mind, I can tell you.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want Jimmy’s will broken,” protested
Barbara, “please don’t try to do that.”</p>

<p>Miss Cottle tossed her head majestically.</p>

<p>“I shall use my own judgment,” she said firmly,
“and I don’t expect no interference; and that reminds
me, I want to speak about that hired man of yours.
He’s brought more truck into that back bedroom,
where you said he was to sleep, than anybody could
keep track of. I told him I wouldn’t have it, and he
answered back in a way I’m not accustomed to hear.
You’ll have to speak to him. Once you’re out the
house, I’ll try to get things regulated. But if I
should be sick&mdash;and I may as well tell you that I’m
subject to bad spells of malaria&mdash;I shall have to send
for my sister from New Hampshire. She’s a widow
with one daughter; of course she’d have to bring Elvira<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
along. I thought I’d tell you, because once
you’re gone you won’t be able to get back. I suppose
your idea is that I’ll do with everything the same
as if it was my own for the five years?”</p>

<p>Miss Cottle’s voice held a rising inflection, and
Barbara murmured something vaguely acquiescent.</p>

<p>“Of course I couldn’t do any other way,” pursued
the spinster; “having left my own nice home to come
here and do for you. The butter and egg money will
be mine, I suppose, and the young chickens? I
couldn’t think of doing any other way than what I’ve
been used to. There! I hear that boy calling you.
That sort of thing will have to be broken up, right in
the beginning&mdash;once you’re out of the house to stay.
A great big boy like that!”</p>

<p>Barbara fled upstairs, the little red book in her
hand, to find Jimmy, in his white night-gown, standing
at the top of the stairs. She caught the child
in her strong young arms, cuddling his cold little
body against her breast.</p>

<p>“I wanted you,” grieved the child, half strangling
her with his eager kisses. “Why do we have that
woman, Barb’ra? I don’t like her. She took my Vallable
Inf’mation book, ’n’&mdash;’n’&mdash;I scwatched her, ’n’
she slapped me. Send her away, Barb’ra; we don’t
want her; do we?”</p>

<p>The girl wrapped a blanket warmly about the child
and sat down with him in a chair by the window. The
iron of her new chain bade fair to eat into her very
soul as she soothed and rocked into forgetfulness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
his troubles the beloved little cause of all her perplexities.
Why, after all, had she done this thing?
Was there not a heavier debt than could be paid in
money? And was she not bankrupt still in love and
peace?</p>

<p>In that hour of darkness all the terrifying consequences
of her attempt to break away from Jarvis
crowded upon her mind. Unless the person who had
paid four thousand dollars for five years of her life
could be induced to release her, she must indeed pay
heavily for Jimmy’s inheritance. Her baffled thoughts
hovered about the unknown personality of this arbiter
of her future.</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” she thought aloud, “I shall know.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">XIV</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">The</span> blossoms had fallen in showers of fragrant pink
and white petals from the wide-spreading boughs of
the Preston orchards and already Peg Morrison’s
dreams of a great harvest were beginning to show
faint promise of fulfilment in long lines of slender
green onion shoots; yet Barbara found herself still
waiting the summons of her unknown master. Her
little trunk, locked and strapped, stood in the closet
of her chamber; her shabby travelling cloak, hat, and
gloves lay ready for instant use. Each morning she
dressed Jimmy, brushed his yellow curls, and saw
him off to school with smiles and kisses, not knowing
whether he would find her upon his return; and each
evening she lavished upon the little boy the hungry
affection hoarded for a lonelier night in some distant
city.</p>

<p>“You love me more’n you used to, don’t you, Barb’ra?”
the child asked, puzzled by the look in her
eyes. “You kiss me kind o’ hard.”</p>

<p>“I always loved you with all my heart, Jimmy,”
she answered. “I couldn’t love you any more.”</p>

<p>“An’ I love you, Barb’ra,” declared the little boy,
“I love you more’n anybody. But,” he added darkly,
“I ’spise that Miss Cottle wiv all my insides an’ all
my outsides. Make her go ’way, Barb’ra.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“Miss Cottle is a good woman, Jimmy,” the girl
told him seriously. “She would take care of you
if&mdash;I should be obliged to go away.”</p>

<p>The child flung himself upon her with an inarticulate
cry of protest.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t go away an’ leave me, would you,
Barb’ra?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t want to, precious; but&mdash;something&mdash;might&mdash;happen.
You will be a good boy, won’t you,
Jimmy? I want you to try and&mdash;love Miss Cottle.”</p>

<p>The child considered this difficult undertaking in
grieved silence for a minute. Then he manfully
swallowed something that arose in his throat and
threatened to choke him.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;guess I’ll be pretty good, Barb’ra,” he
quavered, “if you want t’ go off an’ take a trip. She
said you wanted to take a trip; but I told her you
wouldn’t go anywhere an’ leave me. You wouldn’t,
would you, Barb’ra?”</p>

<p>“Not unless I was forced to,” murmured Barbara,
“for your sake, Jimmy; for your sake!”</p>

<p>She winked back the tears, smiling resolutely.</p>

<p>“Anyway, we won’t cross any bridges till we get
to them, precious.”</p>

<p>“That’s in my book of Vallable Inf’mation,”
Jimmy said proudly. “I copied it out o’ Peg’s.
You have to get to bridges b’fore you cross ’em; you
can’t get over any other way. I told that to Peg,
’n’ he said it was a Vallable Inf’mation, ’n’ he wrote
it down in his book in red ink. We tell each other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
things to write down. I like Peg, an’ he likes me; but
we don’t love Miss Cottle. Peg says, in his opinion,
she’s an ornary female, even if she can spell. Peg
says spellin’ ain’t everythin’.”</p>

<p>As the days passed, this particular bridge of
Barbara’s own building loomed large in the landscape
of her every day, always retreating mirage-like
into the misty horizon of her to-morrow.</p>

<p>Martha Cottle was of the opinion that it was a
mighty queer performance; she discussed the subject
with Barbara with ever-recurring interest and poignancy
in the intervals of her work. Miss Cottle was
a woman bent upon an excruciating cleanliness and
order, and the immaculate back steps and the painfully
scoured kitchen floor uprose as altars upon
which she daily offered oblations and sacrifices of all
the gentler amenities of life.</p>

<p>“That young one,” as she began to call Jimmy,
together with Peg Morrison, appeared to vie with one
another in wanton profanation of these hallowed precincts.</p>

<p>“It’s enough,” the worthy spinster assured Barbara,
her nose and eyes reddened with animosity, “to
make a saint mad clear through. Once you’re out of
the house for good I’ll see to it that they wipe their
feet <i>before they eat</i>.”</p>

<p>The veiled threat in the last words was not lost
on Mr. Morrison. “Me an’ the Cap’n hes et our
victuals together more’n once in the loft t’ the barn,”
he observed placidly. “‘N’ we kin do it ag’in on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
pinch. I kin cook ’s well ’s some others I c’d name,
an’ I will, if necessary.”</p>

<p>Barbara, with one foot on her bridge of passage,
strove to reconcile these opposing forces.</p>

<p>“Miss Cottle,” she assured Peg, “is really a very
conscientious woman. She’ll keep everything clean
and comfortable for you and Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“You bet she’s conscientious, Miss Barb’ry,” acquiesced
the old man dryly. “So’s a skunk. Y’
reelly can’t beat them animals fer a conscientious
pufformance of their duty, es they see it. But it
ain’t what you’d call reelly pleasant fer the dog.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll try, won’t you, Peg, to get along with
Miss Cottle?” implored Barbara. “If she should
leave you after I’m gone, I can’t think what Jimmy
would do.”</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Barb’ry, don’t you worry none.
Me an’ the Cap’n an’ Marthy Cottle ’ll git along like
three kittens in a basket. You bet we will. I’ll kind
o’ humor her, come muddy weather; an’ I’ll see t’ it
that she don’t aggravate the Cap’n beyond what he
can make out t’ bear. Mebbe it’ll stren’then his
char’cter t’ put up with her ways. Viewed in th’
light of a Vallable Inf’mation I shouldn’t wonder if
both me an’ the Cap’n ’ud git consid’able profit out
o’ the experience, even ef we ain’t exac’ly hankerin’
fer it. Meanwhile the onions is comin’ on famous,
likewise the apples. I never see a finer crop o’ young
fruit set.”</p>

<p>To await the slow unfoldment of events, cultivating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the while the cardinal virtues of tranquillity and
faith is the task set before each human being; but
there are times when the lesson becomes poignantly
difficult. As one who awaits the coming of a delayed
train endures the unfruitful minutes with scant
patience, so Barbara lingered on the verge of her
unknown experience, alternately dreading and longing
for the summons which would put an end to
the painful suspense. She found the days speeding
by, gathering themselves into weeks, and the weeks, in
their turn, rolling themselves up into months.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ve said to me about all there is to be
said on the subject of this house and the care of that
child,” Miss Cottle observed in tones of exasperation.
“I’d never have come when I did if I hadn’t
supposed you were going right off. I didn’t bargain
to be your hired girl.”</p>

<p>And David Whitcomb, who had taken up his quarters
in the village inn with the avowed intention of
“having it out” with the owner and arbiter of Barbara’s
future, expressed himself with still greater
frankness on the subject.</p>

<p>“Has it occurred to you,” he asked Barbara, “that
perhaps you’ll not be sent for at all?”</p>

<p>The two were sitting in the long, sweet twilight of
a June evening, on the narrow, old-fashioned porch.
The giant locusts in front of the house were in full
bloom and the clouds of fragrance from their pendant
white clusters mingled with the odorous breath of the
honeysuckles. There was a whir of humming-bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
moths among the vines, and a song-sparrow intent
upon feeding her young ones while the daylight
lasted darted in and out with anxious glances of her
bright eyes.</p>

<p>“Hush!” warned Barbara, wincing. “Don’t let
Jimmy hear you speak of my going.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said David; “the little beggar knows
all about it. Did you suppose he didn’t?”</p>

<p>Barbara looked at him indignantly.</p>

<p>“Did you tell him?”</p>

<p>“No; but I daresay the Cottle person has. Besides,
the auction is town talk. Everybody is wondering,
and some are saying&mdash;&mdash; Do you want me
to tell you what old Hewett asked me to-night?”</p>

<p>Barbara’s face, burning with shamed crimson, was
turned away from his.</p>

<p>“No,” she said frigidly. “I don’t want to hear
it.”</p>

<p>David passed his fingers through his thick, curling
hair, with an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>“I am sorry I spoke of it, Barbara,” he said seriously;
“but the fact is, whether you know it or not,
you’ve been placed in a very unpleasant position.”</p>

<p>He waited for her to speak; but she was obstinately
silent, her eyes fixed on Jimmy, who was helping Peg
load a wheelbarrow with the dried grass left in the
wake of the lawnmower.</p>

<p>“You are,”&mdash;pursued David, “&mdash;or think you are&mdash;unable
to move hand or foot for five years. Meanwhile
you are waiting, waiting for a summons which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
may never come. Barbara, is there anyone you know
who would be likely to&mdash;who might wish to help
you, and who has taken this singular way to do
it?”</p>

<p>She flashed a look of startled inquiry at him.</p>

<p>“The idea of the auction was your own&mdash;though
how you came by it, I can’t understand&mdash;and it succeeded
perfectly, as far as the price paid in money
was concerned; but you’re likely to pay it out in
something more valuable than money. You’ve grown
thin and pale, Barbara; you’re being worn out with
this infernal suspense. Now, I think it’s time we
tracked your purchaser to earth; or else&mdash;look at
me, Barbara! Why not marry me, and defy the fellow,
whoever he is?”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be honorable,” she objected. “I’ve
accepted the money.”</p>

<p>“But if we paid it back?” he urged.</p>

<p>“How can I pay it back, if&mdash;I don’t know who
it is?”</p>

<p>David tipped his chair against the house with an
impatient thud.</p>

<p>“See here,” he said strongly, “I’m going to find
out who the person is, either with or without your
permission. You’d like to know, I suppose?”</p>

<p>She hesitated, evading his eyes.</p>

<p>“I think I’d rather wait,” she said reluctantly.
“Besides, you couldn’t find out.”</p>

<p>He watched her steadily for a minute, while she
set half a dozen hasty stitches in the long ruffle she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
was hemming. Then he deliberately put his hand
over hers.</p>

<p>“It’s too dark to sew,” he objected, “and I can’t
talk to you when your eyes are glued to that piece of
cloth.”</p>

<p>Barbara folded up her work with quick motions
of her slim brown fingers. Then she raised her eyes
to his.</p>

<p>“Well?” she said interrogatively.</p>

<p>“It isn’t anything new, Barbara,” he said. “Just
the same old request. When will you marry me,
dear?”</p>

<p>“I’ve told you, David, over and over. I can’t
make any promises till&mdash;till&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He frowned and shrugged his shoulders impatiently.</p>

<p>“I know,” he interrupted quickly. “But why object
on the score of that absurd contract? Why,
Barbara, I’ll go with you and work for nothing.
Two slaves will be better than one. I’m a husky chap,
capable of trundling the lawnmower, shaking down the
furnace, shovelling snow, or any little job of the sort.
Don’t you think your widower would appreciate my
free services?”</p>

<p>Barbara refused to smile.</p>

<p>“Why,” she asked, “should you suppose it is a
man?”</p>

<p>“A sad mixture of pronouns,” he objected. “‘It’
might, as you suggest, as well be a widow or an old
maid. But why ’its’ waste of money and valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
service? That is what I shall set myself to find out.
But we’ll be married first, and then I’ll be in a position
to defy him, her, or it, as the case may be. And if
no one ever shows up, as I half believe&mdash;&mdash; Barbara,
look at me!”</p>

<p>She obeyed, a mutinous pucker between her fine
dark brows.</p>

<p>“There is no use,” she murmured, “of your talking
that way. I consider myself bound; and I cannot&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>His face softened as he looked at her.</p>

<p>“Poor little girl,” he murmured, “it’s pretty
rough sledding for you, and has been all along.
But I’d like to ask you one thing. Has any other man
asked you to marry him since I went away?”</p>

<p>Her eyes fled into the distance.</p>

<p>“Will you tell me who it was?”</p>

<p>Still she was dumb, struggling to escape the sudden
turmoil of her thoughts.</p>

<p>“Why,” she stammered at last, “should you
ask?”</p>

<p>“Is it a case of ’how happy could I be with either,
were the other fair charmer away?’” he demanded,
a wrathful crimson rising to his bronzed cheeks.
“You’ve played fast and loose with me always, Barbara,
first it was the brat and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He checked himself with an effort.</p>

<p>“Then you won’t tell me?” he said sulkily.</p>

<p>“It&mdash;was nothing,” she stammered. “I didn’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“You didn’t accept him,” he finished for her.
“That’s evident. Well, we’ll call it square if you’ll
say to me, ‘David, I love you, and I’ll marry you as
soon as we can straighten out this&mdash;what shall we
call it?&mdash;this previous engagement.’ Will you say
that, Barbara? Will you?”</p>

<p>She trembled, shrinking into herself under the fire
of his gaze.</p>

<p>“I haven’t told you yet&mdash;what you asked.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that. Come, don’t put me off
again!”</p>

<p>She looked at him, her eyes clouded with doubt and
pain.</p>

<p>“You don’t trust me, Barbara. I see that,” he
said bitterly.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;must make me&mdash;trust you,” she murmured,
after a difficult silence. “I don’t know why&mdash;I can’t
say&mdash;yes. But&mdash;I can’t&mdash;yet.”</p>

<p>“I know,” he said roughly. “You’re half in love
with the other man. Damn him!”</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet, upsetting his chair.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no!” she denied breathlessly. “It isn’t
that. I refused him because”&mdash;her voice trailed off
in a whisper&mdash;“I remembered you, David.”</p>

<p>He caught her in his arms with a triumphant laugh.</p>

<p>“You can’t escape me now, after that admission,”
he told her. “You shall marry me, sweetheart; no
one shall prevent it.”</p>

<p>She yielded to his eyes, his arms, his eager lips
with a sense of mingled relief and terror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“We must not speak of it, David,” she warned
him, “nor&mdash;take too much for granted, till after we
have found out about the contract. We may have
to wait till&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, damn the contract!” cried David exuberantly.
“I’ll find that fellow Smith and make him tell
me all he knows. I’ll fix it up, sweetheart; you’ll
see!”</p>

<p>Jimmy’s rollicking laugh floated across the lawn.
Peg Morrison had stacked the last wheelbarrow with
the sweet lawn grass, topped it with the little boy, and
was trundling his load toward the house with great
pretence of exhaustion.</p>

<p>“Now’t I’ve got you aboard, Cap’n,” Barbara
heard him saying, “it’s all I c’n make out. You’re
turrible big an’ hefty.”</p>

<p>“You won’t ask me to leave him, David?” murmured
Barbara. “I couldn’t do that; unless&mdash;”
she added with quick remembrance&mdash;“I am forced
to.”</p>

<p>“Little beggar!” quoth David good-humoredly;
“he’s always been a dangerous rival of mine. But
I’ll take him for a side partner this time, Barbara.
How’ll that suit you?”</p>

<p>He turned and crushed her roughly in his arms.</p>

<p>“I’ve waited long enough,” he said, “now let
everybody and everything get out of my way; I’m
going to marry you within the month,” and stopped
the words of protest on her lips with his kisses.</p>

<p>That same evening Martha Cottle wandered forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
under the soft light of the rosy evening. She was
dressed in a full-skirted gown of lilac calico, sprigged
with white, and starched to rustling stiffness; over it
flowed the wide expanse of a freshly ironed white
apron. The labors of the day were concluded and
Miss Cottle felt herself attuned to the soft influences
of the hour. So when she chanced to come upon Peleg
Morrison reposing himself in a battered wooden chair
tipped against the barn door, she addressed him in
terms of surprising amity.</p>

<p>“It’s a real pleasant evening,” observed Miss
Cottle, with an agreeable smile.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am, it sure is,” replied Peg, in kind.
In deference to the lady he shook the ashes out of his
pipe, and rose from his chair.</p>

<p>“I suppose you and I’ll soon be left in charge
here,” continued Miss Cottle, sighing. “For my
part, I dr-read the responsibility.”</p>

<p>“Hes&mdash;Miss Barb’ry heard f’om&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No; not that I know of. And I call it strange&mdash;very
str-range. Don’t you, Mr. Morrison?”</p>

<p>Peg removed his hat and thoughtfully fumbled the
scanty locks behind his ears.</p>

<p>“‘Tis kind o’ queer; that’s so,” he agreed.</p>

<p>Miss Cottle bent forward, her lean features quivering
with emotion.</p>

<p>“And to cap the climax,” she said, “the girl’s
gone and engaged herself to be married.”</p>

<p>“Who? Not Miss Barb’ry?”</p>

<p>Miss Cottle nodded confirmation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“To that young Whitcomb fellow,” she concluded
acidly.</p>

<p>Mr. Morrison resumed his hat, pulling it low over
his eyes. From this familiar shelter he viewed his
informant cautiously.</p>

<p>“Did she&mdash;did Miss Barb’ry tell you? Mebbe she
wouldn’t care to hev me know.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t choose to make a confidant of me,” the
spinster said, tossing her head. “I chanced to be
passing through the hall, and I&mdash;overheard ’em&mdash;spooning.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morrison coughed deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“It’s a vallable idee,” he said slowly, “not t’ hear
what you ain’t meant t’ hear. Young Whitcomb&mdash;huh?
Wall! Wall!”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">XV</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">David Whitcomb</span> sat in the dining-room of the Barford
Eagle. It was fifteen minutes of eleven by the
loud-ticking clock, with a calendar attachment proclaiming
a new day, which hung against the wall in
full view of the breakfaster, yet he appeared quite
unabashed by the lateness of the hour as he attacked
the platter of fried ham and eggs which the pink-cheeked
waitress set before him. She was a pretty
girl with curly light hair and wide open eyes of an
innocent babyish blue.</p>

<p>“Here’s your toast, Mr. Whitcomb, nice an’
hot&mdash;jus’ as you like it,” she said, reaching over his
shoulder to set a covered plate before him. “An’ I
tried the coffee m’self this morning. That ol’ cook,
she makes me good and tired! <i>She</i> don’t care
whether you like things or not.”</p>

<p>David flashed a brilliant smile at the waitress.</p>

<p>“You’re a nice little girl, Jennie,” he said, and
tasted the steaming cup which she handed him.
Then he made a wry face.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it good?” asked the girl, with a grieved
droop of her full red lips. “I made it jus’s you
said, with the egg an’ all, an’ it jus’ boiled up good
once. I stood right over it for all o’ that nasty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Sarah. She swatted me with her dish-towel, ’cause I
wouldn’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It’s made well enough,” interrupted David; “but
it’s a cheap brand of coffee, and&mdash;bring the coffee-pot
here; will you?”</p>

<p>“The coffee-pot?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Bring it here; the one you make my coffee
in.”</p>

<p>The girl disappeared kitchenward with a hasty
rustling of her crisp blue gingham skirts. David
leaned back in his chair and thrust both hands in his
trousers pockets while he eyed the table service of
coarse crockery and cheap glass with a cynical
smile. Three or four flies hovered aimlessly about
the plate of buttered toast, and one crawled into the
half-filled cream jug where it buzzed helplessly, its
wings spattered with the liquid.</p>

<p>“Damn!” muttered David, pushing back his chair
and yawning. There were shrill voices in loud altercation
in the not distant kitchen, the sound of a hard-shut
door, and the waitress reappeared, red-cheeked
and breathless, bearing a large black coffee-pot in
her two hands held far in front of her.</p>

<p>“Here it is, Mr. Whitcomb,” she said. “That
nasty ol’ cook was bound I shouldn’t bring it in ’ere.
She threw dish-water on my clean apron. I could ’a’
killed her!”</p>

<p>She held the coffee-pot for his inspection and
David lifted the lid, peered in, and sniffed disgustedly.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” he said. “I thought so. Now I like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
decent coffee, and I’ll buy a coffee-pot just to make
my coffee in. Do you suppose you could keep it, so
that termagant in the kitchen wouldn’t annex it?”</p>

<p>“You bet I can,” giggled the girl delightedly, “an’
I’ll do it, too, jus’ to spite Sarah. An’ I’ll make your
coffee every morning. I’d love to, Mr. Whitcomb.”</p>

<p>“Good girl,” drawled David. He waved his hand
toward the table. “You may as well take these
things away,” he said. “I’m&mdash;er&mdash;not hungry this
morning.”</p>

<p>The girl’s face fell; her full lips quivered and
pouted like a child’s on the verge of sobbing.</p>

<p>“I made the toast,” she said. “I made it jus’ like
you said. It&mdash;it’s good.”</p>

<p>David uncovered the plate hastily.</p>

<p>“It looks fine, Jennie; but you see it’s so near
dinner-time&mdash;see here, my girl, you buy the coffee-pot
for me; will you?&mdash;just a plain tin one, mind. And&mdash;er&mdash;keep
the change.”</p>

<p>He threw a crisp bill on the table.</p>

<p>The girl took up the money and folded it together
carefully. When she raised her blue eyes they were
swimming in tears.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’ll do anythin’ you say,” she whimpered,
“anythin’ you want me to.”</p>

<p>By way of answer, perhaps, David pushed back his
chair with a harsh, scraping sound that echoed dismally
through the empty room. Then he rose,
clapped his straw hat on the back of his curly head,
searched for his cigarette case and matches and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
stalked out to the piazza by way of the passage
which, in country fashion, afforded an easy mode of
transit between the bar and the dining-room. At
one side of the passage was set a high, ink-spattered
desk, and behind it a long-legged stool, upon which
perched a fattish, elderly man intent upon a ledger.
This individual appeared to feel the heat of the June
morning exceedingly, for he mopped his face from
time to time with a large handkerchief, in the intervals
of setting down laborious lines of figures.
He looked up as David Whitcomb approached,
and his large face creased itself into a dubious
smile.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Sutton,” remarked David blandly.
“Finding out how much the public owes you for your
astonishing good cheer&mdash;eh?”</p>

<p>“Mornin’, Mr. Whitcomb,” mumbled the Boniface.
“Um&mdash;yes; I was sort of goin’ over m’ books.
Warm mornin’, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>He eyed David closely, taking note apparently of
the heavy ring of virgin gold on the third finger of
his left hand and descending slyly to the polished
toes of his tan Oxfords.</p>

<p>“How much do I owe you?” asked the young man
nonchalantly, allowing a thin wreath of smoke to
escape from his lips.</p>

<p>“‘Twon’t break ye, I guess,” hazarded Mr. Sutton,
pushing a slip of pink paper across the desk with
alacrity. “The’s a few extrys on this week’s bill,”
he added, breathing heavily as he indicated with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
handle of his pen various items annotated on the account.</p>

<p>David flung his half-smoked cigarette out of the
open window and produced a roll of bills from his
pocket, from which he detached one.</p>

<p>“Take it out of that,” he said carelessly. “I need
some change.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; all right, sir. Thank you, sir,” said
Mr. Sutton effusively.</p>

<p>He sucked in his lips in a windy whisper as he
counted out the change in bills of smaller denominations
and topped them with a little pile of silver.</p>

<p>“Hope you find everythin’ t’ your likin’ at the
Eagle.”</p>

<p>David shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right,” he said. “I’m used to roughing
it.”</p>

<p>The hotel-keeper signed his name to the receipted
bill with a heavy flourish.</p>

<p>“Heh?” he ejaculated.</p>

<p>Then he climbed hastily down from his perch.</p>

<p>“Come across,” he said hospitably, “an’ have one
on me. Anythin’ you say, Mr. Whitcomb.”</p>

<p>“Something cold, if you have it,” David directed
the bartender”&mdash;and bitter. No, no! not too much
of that. Fill it up with water.”</p>

<p>He drank thirstily and set down the glass, lifting
his eyes to look out of the window at a passing
vehicle.</p>

<p>“That’s the Hon’rable S. Jarvis, <i>Es</i>quire,” pronounced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
his host, sucking his lips over the contents of
his own glass. “Warm man, Jarvis.”</p>

<p>“By that you mean?” queried David, strolling
toward the door.</p>

<p>“He’s got the rocks, Jarvis has; but my! ain’t he
the screechin’ limit? I’ll bet you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Sutton waddled heavily after David, and
seated himself comfortably in one of the big splint-bottomed
chairs ranged along the piazza for the convenience
of patrons.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you,” he concluded, “he’s got half a million
salted down, if he’s got a penny.”</p>

<p>“Is there a decent horse in the stable?” inquired
David, after a silence, which Mr. Sutton filled in with
various animal-like noises, expressive of his entire
physical comfort.</p>

<p>“No; but I c’n git y’ one over to the livery stable.
I’ll send over for it, if you say so,” Mr. Sutton responded.</p>

<p>“I want to find Bellows,” David said.</p>

<p>“Who? The auctioneer? Wall, y’ don’t need no
livery hoss t’ locate Thomas. He’s over t’ Henry
Maclin’s this mornin’, sellin’ out the stock. Hank’s
concluded to go west. Thinks there’s more doin’ out
there. But I dunno ’bout that. You mus’ know
somethin’ ’bout the West?”</p>

<p>David was smoking a second cigarette with short,
impatient puffs.</p>

<p>“I’ve been there,” he admitted, with a transient
scowl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“How’d you like it?” asked Mr. Sutton, folding
his pudgy hands across his protuberant front.
“What sort of a place is it? Gamblers&mdash;heh?
Cowboys, shootin’ parties, sage brush, prairie fires,
etcetery&mdash;heh?”</p>

<p>“You’ve named the principal features of the great
West,” drawled David. “It’s all there, more particularly
the et cetera. There’s lots of that roaming
about.”</p>

<p>He pulled his hat over his eyes and stepped down
from the veranda.</p>

<p>“I may not be back to dinner,” he said, “but I’d
like a decent steak for supper, if you can get it in this
centre of civilization.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sutton watched the young man’s muscular
figure in its leisurely progress down the street. Then
he went back to the barroom, where his underling, a
slim, sallow young man, with oily black hair parted
very particularly in the middle of his narrow
head, was languidly arranging clean glasses on a
tray.</p>

<p>“He’s hot stuff, ain’t he?” observed the bartender.</p>

<p>“Who?&mdash;Whitcomb?”</p>

<p>“Thinks he’s the whole thing, don’t he?”</p>

<p>Mr. Sutton frowned. “I ain’t made up my mind
’bout that young feller,” he said ponderously. “But
I’m kind of watchin’ him. It strikes me he’ll bear&mdash;watchin’.”</p>

<p>David Whitcomb, walking slowly down the village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
street under the shade of the spreading maples, was
experiencing that vague dissatisfaction which in individuals
of his temperament is apt to follow the
attainment of some hotly pursued desire. Barbara
had long represented to his imagination the distant,
unsealed peak, the untrodden wild, the unstaked, unexplored
claim. He had come back from the West
with no very fixed intention of marrying her; but
with something of the languid curiosity the traveller
feels regarding scenes long unvisited.</p>

<p>He had not felt at all sure that he would find
Barbara the lovely vision that he had pictured her,
in the infrequent intervals given to a vague remembrance
of past days. But he had lost sight of his indifference
in the excitement of the auction and his
subsequent impulsive endeavors to break down the
girl’s scruples. Now he had won her, fairly or unfairly,
and he was thinking with some irritation of
the future to which he had committed himself. The
dull vista of a married life, spent in hard work on a
farm, which in the end could not belong to him, appeared
more and more intolerable the longer he dwelt
upon it. He was in a thoroughly bad humor by the
time he had reached the scene of Thomas Bellows’
latest activities.</p>

<p>Henry Maclin’s hardware, flour, and feed store
was situated on the outskirts of the village. As
David approached it he could hear the loud voice of
the auctioneer upraised in the raucous monotone of
his calling, and the dull thud of his hammer, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
proclaimed the sale of the various articles an assistant
was rapidly passing up to him.</p>

<p>David sauntered up to the edge of the crowd and
stood there, gloomily reviewing the events of the
previous month. He glanced up suddenly to find a
keen pair of eyes riveted upon him.</p>

<p>“Mornin’, Mr. Whitcomb,” called Peg Morrison,
as if he feared the young man might attempt to
avoid him. “Thinkin’ o’ biddin’ in any o’ the stuff?
The best of it’s gone b’ now. I got a good cross-cut
saw, though. B’en wantin’ one fer quite a spell.
The’s quite a lot o’ dead timber standin’ on th’ farm
in diff’rent places ’at ought t’ come down.”</p>

<p>David was plainly indifferent, and after cautiously
studying his unresponsive face Mr. Morrison went
on.</p>

<p>“Miss Barb’ry, she leaves mos’ everythin’ t’ me;
but the’s times when I feel as ’o I’d like a man t’ go
over the place with me. Course she’s got her idees, an’
some o’ ’em’s all right; but I d’clar’ I hate t’ see
her botherin’ with outdoor work. Females had ought
to keep house an’ sew an’ look after the cookin’, an’
not be tryin’ t’ do men’s work b’sides. That’s what I
tell her, an’ I been thinkin’ ’at some day you’d go
’round with me, since you’re such a good friend o’
Miss Barb’ry’s.”</p>

<p>David frowned in an irritated fashion.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand farming, my good fellow,” he
said coldly. “So I’m afraid my advice wouldn’t
prove very valuable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s jus’ what I was thinkin’,” was Peg’s incautious
comment. “An’ mebbe fer that very reason,
you’d better&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He hesitated and stopped short under the steady
stare of Whitcomb’s blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Y’&mdash;see,” he blundered on, “ef Miss Barb’ry
hes to go ’way fer five years, I was thinkin’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She won’t go away for five years, if I can help
it,” said David. “I’m going to try and get her out
of the mess she’s made of things.”</p>

<p>His eyes wrinkled at the corners and he laughed
outright at the strange working of Peg’s untutored
features.</p>

<p>“Don’t you bother your old head about Miss
Barbara’s affairs,” he said carelessly, “nor”&mdash;his
keen look threatened serious displeasure&mdash;“mine.”</p>

<p>He turned decidedly and made his way towards
Bellows, who had just disposed of the last lot of
merchandise and stepped down from his perch among
the rapidly dispersing crowd.</p>

<p>But the auctioneer could not, when questioned,
furnish the address of the small man in checked
clothes, who had paid four thousand dollars for a
hypothetical term of Barbara’s service. He shook
his head vigorously when urged to a further explanation
of what had immediately followed the event at
the Preston farm.</p>

<p>“Nope,” he persisted. “I can’t help you none. I
done all I was paid t’ do an’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>David whipped out a yellow-backed bill from his
vest-pocket.</p>

<p>“You had references,” he said in a cautious tone,
“for I heard you say so. Who figured as referee?”</p>

<p>Mr. Bellows waved David’s hand aside.</p>

<p>“It’d cost me more’n you’ve got t’ tell you,” he
said. “Nope. I ain’t a-goin’ t’ say nothin’ more.
Anyway, what business is it of yours?”</p>

<p>David did not choose to acquaint the auctioneer
with the reasons for his anxiety, and presently he
found himself walking swiftly along the road leading
to the Preston farm. He was uncomfortably hungry
by this time, but with the unreason of the average
man attributed his gloomy feelings to a higher source
than his clamorous stomach.</p>

<p>Barbara met him at the door with an agitated
face.</p>

<p>“I have heard from&mdash;the person who&mdash;&mdash; Oh,
I was hoping you would come!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean the fellow who bought you?” he
demanded sharply. Her apparent faith in himself
he passed over without notice. “Has he been here?”</p>

<p>“No-o,” murmured Barbara. “But I had a
letter.”</p>

<p>She put it into his hand, and watched him eagerly,
timidly, while he read it. She had lain awake half
the night, thinking of David, of his eyes, of the strong
pressure of his arms, of the touch of his lips upon
hers. Love had drawn near at last, and she bent her
head meekly to his accolade, almost forgetting her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
chain in the rapture of the moment. But with the
morning had come the painful recurrence of all her
doubts and fears; and later, as if in answer to her
agitated questionings, the letter.</p>

<p>David read it with frowning brows.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing in this,” he said impatiently,
“to show you who the person is, nor when you’ll be
called for.”</p>

<p>“No,” Barbara agreed faintly. “But you
see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It’s some mean dog-in-the-manger, who is watching
you in secret, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped short.</p>

<p>“The boy is coming,” he said, and got to his feet.</p>

<p>“You’ll stay to dinner?” she begged him timidly.
“I made cherry pies this morning. I think”&mdash;humbly&mdash;“that
they’re that they’re very good.”</p>

<p>David put his arm around her, with a sudden untraced
impulse of tenderness.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about the letter,” he said magnificently.
“I’ll&mdash;think it over.”</p>

<p>It was a very happy meal they ate together, in
spite of the prying presence of Miss Cottle, who had
assumed control of the teapot. There was stewed
chicken, an abundance of fresh vegetables, strawberries
and yellow cream, and, to top off with, the
cherry pie of such unexampled excellence that David
forgot the unpleasant doubts which had assailed
him in the morning. As he sat, smoking a cigarette,
on the shaded porch at the conclusion of the meal, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
occurred to him that the farm was not, after all, so
bad a place to live. His eyes wandered dreamily
across the broad fields to the blue distance, and lingered
there unseeingly.</p>

<p>Barbara came out presently and sat down at his
side.</p>

<p>“I should be so happy,” she sighed, “if&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Eh&mdash;what?” he roused himself to say. He
reached out and patted her hand. “Why be unhappy
about anything&mdash;just now?” he murmured.
He smiled dreamily into her eyes. “The dinner was
perfect, sweetheart; as for the reminder from your
unknown, why not be thankful that ’it’ contents
itself with correspondence?”</p>

<p>Barbara turned her eyes away. An aching lump
arose in her throat as if to choke her. When she
finally answered him it was in a low, controlled voice.</p>

<p>“There will be other letters&mdash;other reminders;
you saw that.”</p>

<p>David was at the moment languidly optimistic. It
occurred to him to silence her grieving lips with a
kiss; but he was too drowsily comfortable to move.
He contented himself by again caressing her fingertips.</p>

<p>“Don’t poison our happiness by perpetual references
to something neither of us can possibly help,”
he murmured.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XVI</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">There</span> is that which works secretly (call it what you
will), everywhere transmuting the ugly into the beautiful,
the seeming evil into acknowledged good, the
mean and worthless into the rare and precious; moving
upon the face of vasty deeps, upon inchoate
planets; toiling in unknowable abysses, whirling in
star-dust and nebulæ, and no less in the veiled darkness
of the holiest place&mdash;the soul of man. And
here, indeed, this pervasive life principle, this informing
Mind, this toiling servant of universes and men
(call it what you will), seeks chiefly to manifest its
supernal powers. Give it entrance in any fashion;
open to it the smallest crevice; entertain its mysterious
presence ever so briefly, and in that lodgment it
begins at once its wonder-working transmutations.
For observe: this unseen, and often unsuspected,
worker takes of the common things of life, of its base
and ignoble things and turns them into shapes of imperishable
beauty. And observe, also: this is accomplished
without tumult of manufacture; neither smoke
of his burning furnace, nor clang of hammer, nor noise
of breaking stone is heard, though one listen with the
fine ear of the magician in the fable. And observe
for a third time (for all of this has to do with the
tale that is told): that the blind desire of the one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
is thus wrought upon in some mysterious fashion relates
itself to the will of Him who works, so that they
are in a way one and indissoluble. For such is the
law of growth in all the universe, and such will it
ever be.</p>

<p>To Stephen Jarvis, pursuing to all outward appearance
the even tenor of a way long trodden, came
slight intimation of the changes in himself&mdash;the self
deep submerged beneath the surface of everyday life.
He still loaned money on bond and mortgage, exacting,
as was his custom, the highest legal rate of interest.
As in the past, he looked sharply after his
investments, foreclosing when foreclosure had become
due and inevitable, and manipulating such conservative
purchases of stocks and bonds as his accumulating
capital appeared to require. He was conscious
of but one thing, and that was that these procedures
no longer afforded him pleasure. They were,
on the contrary, in the nature of labor. After a
little, the labor became grinding in its demands upon
him. Gradually, too, he found that the heavy looks
and sad faces of certain of his debtors had the power
to hurt him. One day he actually yielded to the
importunities of a poor widow, not openly, indeed,
but through a trusted agent of his, restoring to her
the home she had lost. Once indulged, this folly
(as he called it), grew upon him stealthily. More
and more frequently he found himself giving; still
secretly, because in his mind giving still appeared to
him a despicable weakness. Yet he continued to impart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
(where he must) with that keen discrimination
and sound judgment which had always distinguished
his operations in finance. As yet no one suspected
him. To have incurred a suspicion of benevolence
would have shamed him little less than a well-founded
conjecture of crime on the part of those who had always
known him.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he who runs may read the legible
handwriting of God on the faces of men. The cold,
immobile features of the grasping money-getter
changed subtly, as was indeed inevitable, into something
more human; his eyes looked out from beneath
his sternly modelled brows as keenly as ever, yet in
their very penetration there was a veiled light not
visible before.</p>

<p>Perhaps the creature who might have told the most
unbelievable story of the change in Stephen Jarvis
was his horse. He no longer drove under the lash
and with the cowardly curb-bit. He simply did not
care any longer for the sensation afforded by beating
down an inferior intelligence with his own brute force.
No other reason for this particular change in his
habits had as yet occurred to him. He still used
fast horses; but he ceased to abuse them.</p>

<p>Nearly two months had elapsed since his last visit
to the Preston farm. On that occasion he had entreated
Barbara not to shame him before the crowd
assembled for the auction; and she had refused to
listen. Then he had gone away. Something of what
followed had been repeated to him. And since he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
learned of the return of David Whitcomb from the
West; of his spectacular part in the bidding, and
of his subsequent visits to the farm.</p>

<p>It was of David he was thinking as he drove along
the country roads on a day in early August. The
fields were yellowing to the harvest and a great
peace lay upon the face of Nature, veiled lightly
with the long continued heat. When, therefore, he
overtook the object of his thoughts walking along
the dusty road with every appearance of discomfort,
he drew up his horse and spoke to him.</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen you to speak with you, since your
return, Mr. Whitcomb,” he said civilly. “Won’t
you get in and ride with me? I shall be glad to&mdash;talk
with you.”</p>

<p>David stared with undisguised astonishment; then
a derisive gleam shone in his blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;er&mdash;certainly, Mr. Jarvis,” he said, and
sprang in and seated himself with cool assurance.
“It wouldn’t have occurred to me to ask you for a
ride,” he went on, “but I’m not sorry you offered
to give me a lift. It’s deucedly unpleasant walking.”</p>

<p>Jarvis met his inquiring look gravely.</p>

<p>“You are making quite a stay in the East,” he
said. “Do you mean to settle here?”</p>

<p>The quick blood rose in David’s face.</p>

<p>“I haven’t made up my mind,” he said. “I’m&mdash;er&mdash;just
looking around a bit.”</p>

<p>Jarvis was silent, casting about in his mind for a
suitable opening for what he wished to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>David spared him the trouble. With his usual
sensitiveness to the moods of his companions&mdash;a sensitiveness
which at times amounted almost to divination&mdash;he
looked sidewise at Jarvis, a smile wrinkling
the corners of his eyes.</p>

<p>“I’ve been to see Miss Preston,” he said confidentially,
“at the farm.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” Jarvis observed non-committally.</p>

<p>“You know Miss Preston, I believe?” said David.</p>

<p>Jarvis hesitated.</p>

<p>“I have had business relations with Miss Preston,”
he said coolly. He was beginning to feel an exceeding
dislike of the well-dressed, smiling young man
at his side.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed David, shrugging his shoulders.
“she’s mentioned the fact to me.”</p>

<p>Jarvis tightened his grasp on the reins after his
old choleric fashion, and the mare leaped forward
as if expecting the cut of the ready lash.</p>

<p>“I understand Miss Preston has been relieved of&mdash;her
anxieties somewhat,” he said evenly. “I&mdash;was
glad to know it.”</p>

<p>David’s lip curled.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” he syllabled with a touch of insolence.
“Well, I’ve no doubt Barbara&mdash;Miss Preston&mdash;will
be duly grateful, when&mdash;er&mdash;I mention the fact of
your interest in her affairs.”</p>

<p>“You’ll not mention it, I hope,” Jarvis said.
After a brief silence he added, “You understand me,
of course.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, no,” drawled David. “I don’t believe I
do.”</p>

<p>He looked whimsically at Jarvis, as if expecting
further elucidation.</p>

<p>But the older man was paying strict attention to
his horse, his lips set in forbidding lines.</p>

<p>David yielded to one of his sudden impulses.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he burst out; “you won’t care;
you’ve got your money out of it; but Barbara is
deucedly unhappy.”</p>

<p>“Ah?”</p>

<p>Jarvis’s note of interrogation was barely audible.</p>

<p>“You know, I suppose, for it’s become town-talk
long ago, that somebody bid her in&mdash;a thundering
shame I call it&mdash;and then failed to show up. She
considers herself bound, since she used the money&mdash;or
part of it. I’d like mighty well to get hold of
the person, male or female, who’s skulking behind
the contract&mdash;as she persists in regarding
it.”</p>

<p>“Why? What’s wrong with the transaction?”</p>

<p>Jarvis’s tone asked for information merely, but
David flashed a suspicious look at him.</p>

<p>“Do you know anything about it?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Do I&mdash;know anything about Miss Preston’s affairs?”
echoed Jarvis. “Isn’t that a singular question
for you to put to me?”</p>

<p>“It would be, if I hadn’t run every possible scent
to earth already. I want to find the fellow.”</p>

<p>“For what purpose?” queried Jarvis, leaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
forward to watch the even play of his mare’s hoofs.</p>

<p>“I want to pay him back and free the girl. It’s
a damned outrage to hold a woman bound in this
sneaking, secret fashion. It doesn’t give either of
us any show.”</p>

<p>Jarvis appeared to ponder this statement in silence
for a while.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’re right,” he said, at last.</p>

<p>“There’s no ‘perhaps’ about it,” said David excitedly.
“Of course I’m right! Here I’ve been
hanging about for months, waiting for the person&mdash;whoever
it is&mdash;to show up. I’m ready to settle the
business by paying back the money.”</p>

<p>He met the other’s sharply inquiring look with a
boastful grimace.</p>

<p>“I can do it; don’t make any mistake on that
score!”</p>

<p>“And after you’ve made the transfer; what
then?”</p>

<p>Jarvis’s tone was icy; his eyes searched the handsome,
flushed face at his side mercilessly.</p>

<p>David met his gaze readily enough.</p>

<p>“Why,” he blustered, “you may as well know:
I intend to marry Barbara. I’d do it, anyway; contract
or no contract, and let that damned dog in the
manger gnaw his bone till he’s tired of it; only
Barbara&mdash;Miss Preston&mdash;objects. She’s like all
women&mdash;sticks at a trifle, and yet is ready to swallow
the earth, if you give ’em a chance.”</p>

<p>“Miss Preston doubtless supposes that her honor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
is involved. I can conceive that she might do so.
A trifle, I believe you called it. And if you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, come; what’s the use of talking like that!”
David interrupted impatiently. “I’m sick of all that
sort of nonsense.” He pulled his hat over his eyes
and stared morosely at the landscape. “If I didn’t
care as much about the girl as I do, I’d cut the whole
thing and go west again. This is no place for a
man like me.”</p>

<p>“I’m disposed to agree with you,” observed Jarvis
calmly. “Shall I set you down here?”</p>

<p>David recognized his surroundings with a start.
They had reached the outskirts of the village, and
Jarvis had stopped his horse in front of his own
house.</p>

<p>“Oh, I may as well get out here, I suppose,” he
said sullenly.</p>

<p>He turned and lifted his hat to Jarvis, with a
sweeping bow.</p>

<p>“Much obliged for the delightful ride,” he said,
with a sneering upward quirk of the mouth.</p>

<p>Jarvis sat motionless in his carriage watching the
easy swing of the arrogantly youthful figure, as it
passed down the street. He saw David go in
at the front entrance of the Barford Eagle, yet
still he sat silent, his brows drawn over brooding
eyes.</p>

<p>His man, lounging in front of the stables, caught
sight of the waiting equipage, and hurried down the
driveway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“Any orders, sir?” he asked. “Shall I take the
horse, sir?”</p>

<p>Jarvis glanced at the man, something of his old
irritability flaring up in his look.</p>

<p>“No,” he said shortly. “I’m not coming in now.”</p>

<p>He spoke sharply to his horse, turned abruptly,
and drove rapidly away, past the pollarded willows,
over the echoing bridge, and on into the country
road beyond, muffled with the accumulated dust of
a rainless midsummer. Presently he reached and
passed the stone gateway of the Preston farm, and
its orchards laden with unripe fruit. He looked at
both with the sombre, unseeing intentness of a man
who is at war with his deeper instincts.</p>

<p>He had been prepared, he supposed, to judge
Whitcomb fairly; but his late brief interview with his
successful rival had left him bitterly antagonistic
to the younger man. David’s very physical beauty
infuriated him. He recalled the level glances of his
blue eyes, the curve of his lips, the carriage of his
handsome head upon his broad shoulders, with a sense
of blind, barbaric anger. His frequent references to
Barbara, his cool assumption of triumph, his braggart
self-assertion, his open disdain of concealment&mdash;all
were abhorrent, intolerable to Jarvis. But none
the less, he fought with and subdued himself.</p>

<p>“I am unjust,” he told himself flatly, “because I
am jealous.”</p>

<p>And he despised himself the more, because recognizing
the patent fact he still hated David; still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
longed to fling him out of his path as he had flung
many a stronger man in the past. For the first
time in all the years of his life he had become dimly
aware of the beauty of self-sacrifice, and of its relations
to a pure and true affection. Even while the
primal man within foamed under his iron grip, he
compelled himself to think tenderly of Barbara, of
her loveless youth, of her loneliness, of her heroism.
Then he remembered with shame his own persecutions
of her woman’s weakness; for so it had come to look
to him now. He recalled his brutal insistence, his
threats, his unrelenting hardness, sparing himself
in nothing, compelling his memory to flash before
him every picture which contained them both.</p>

<p>He had travelled many miles before he roused to
a realization of the lateness of the hour. The long
summer twilight had fallen, like a roseate veil, over
the rich landscape; the shadows had disappeared
with the sun, and the great disk of a silver moon
swam in the rosy light reflected from the sunset,
which by now burned in crimson and amber splendors
behind the misty purple of the hills.</p>

<p>His horse appeared jaded and weary, and Jarvis
recalled vaguely that he had been driving at his old
furious rate of speed. He leaned back against the
cushions with a sigh, conscious of his own exceeding
weariness, and allowed the mare to take her own
gait. Out of the seething alembic of his thoughts
had crystallized a single definite resolution. He
would deal with Whitcomb as that son of God who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
was called Satan was permitted to deal with Job, and
later with the recalcitrant apostle. He would sift
David as wheat in the close-meshed sieve of his own
love for Barbara. He would scrutinize his past, he
would examine his present; he would hold him under
the lens of purity, of probity, of honor. If Whitcomb
stood the test, Jarvis swore by all that he held
holy that he would stand back and allow him to
marry the woman both loved. If not,&mdash;his strong
fingers unconsciously tightened on the reins, and the
obedient mare quickened her pace.</p>

<p>There was a light twinkling among the dark trees
when at last Jarvis again passed the big apple-farm.
He got down from his buggy, fastened the horse to
a tree, and walked quietly toward the house. The
long French windows stood open to the breeze, and
within the lamp-lighted room Jarvis caught sight of
Barbara. She was sitting close to the table reading
aloud; at her side, leaning his yellow head against
her knee, sat Jimmy, serious and intent. Barbara’s
pleasant voice rang out in the stillness:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Through all the pleasant meadow-side<br />
The grass grew shoulder high,<br />
Till the shining scythes went far and wide<br />
And cut it down to dry.”</p>

<p class="p1">“That’s haying,” observed Jimmy, with satisfaction.
“Ours is all in the barn now.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Barbara, “listen:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Those green and sweetly smelling crops<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>They led in wagons home;<br />
And they piled them here in mountain tops<br />
For mountaineers to roam.<br />
O, what a joy to clamber there,<br />
O, what a place for play,<br />
With the sweet, the dim, the dusty air,<br />
The happy hills of hay!”</p>

<p class="p1">Jarvis stepped boldly to the piazza, and tapped
on the open sash.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s David!” he heard the child say joyously.
And saw the quick blush that rose to Barbara’s
cheek.</p>

<p>The blood sprang to his own temples and hammered
furiously there for an instant as he looked at
her in her diaphanous white dress. Then he entered
at her quiet bidding.</p>

<p>“I was passing, and it occurred to me to stop,
and&mdash;see you,” he said awkwardly.</p>

<p>Jimmy had retreated behind his sister’s chair and
was gazing at him with frowning intentness. Manifestly
the child was disappointed. Whitcomb would
fit into the scene far better than himself, Jarvis was
forced to acknowledge. He saw the wonderment in
Barbara’s eyes, and mingled with it he fancied he
could detect cold dislike and fear.</p>

<p>“You were reading,” he said, his eyes lingering
on the hands which held the thin blue volume.
“Won’t you&mdash;&mdash;” He hesitated; then went on
boldly: “Don’t stop because I am here.”</p>

<p>She would have turned over the leaves and read
other pretty trifles if it had been David instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
himself, he thought bitterly. He waited for a cold
refusal.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t like ‘A Child’s Garden of Verses,’”
Jimmy said unexpectedly. He had not removed his
inquiring brown eyes from Jarvis’s face. Something
that he saw there emboldened him. “It’s for little
boys, littler than I am; but I like it.”</p>

<p>Jarvis smiled, the singular smile new to his lips
and of which he was not at all aware, any more than
of the elemental changes in himself.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I’d like it, too,” he said. “Nobody ever
reads out loud to me.”</p>

<p>“Read the one about the wind, Barb’ra,” urged
Jimmy. “The wind and the kites. I like that.”</p>

<p>Barbara turned over the pages slowly.</p>

<p>“Shall I?” she asked Jarvis.</p>

<p>Her eyes lingered irresolutely on his face for an
instant. It was evident that she was wondering at
the sight of him there, pale and grave, but with an
unfamiliar gentleness in his eyes and about his unsmiling
lips.</p>

<p>“If you will,” he said.</p>

<p>Read Barbara:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“I saw you toss the kites on high<br />
And blow the birds about the sky<br />
And all around I heard you pass,<br />
Like ladies’ skirts across the grass&mdash;<br />
O wind, a-blowing all day long,<br />
O wind, that sings so loud a song!<br />
I saw the different things you did,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>But always you yourself you hid,<br />
I felt you push, I heard you call,<br />
I could not see yourself at all&mdash;<br />
O wind, a-blowing all day long,<br />
O wind, that sings so loud a song!”</p>

<p class="p1">Her voice, flowing on like a brook over pebbles,
fell to a sudden silence, as the wind of which she had
been reading entered with a sudden rush, veering the
yellow flame of the lamp to one side.</p>

<p>Jimmy laughed joyously.</p>

<p>“It’s come in here,” he said, turning a sleepily
roguish face upon Jarvis, “to hear what you’re
saying, Barb’ra.”</p>

<p>She closed the book and laid it quietly upon the
table.</p>

<p>“You must go to bed now, Jimmy,” she said.</p>

<p>The little boy whispered in her ear, his hands
clasped about her neck. Her arm stole about his
small body as she bent her head to listen. Jarvis
watched the two hungrily&mdash;the child and the woman,
and the eternal, unfading beauty of the picture
smote him with almost intolerable poignancy. All
that was best in life he had missed, blunderingly,
blindly, and for what?</p>

<p>“I go to bed all by myself now,” the little boy
said proudly.</p>

<p>He walked toward the door; then turned, hesitated,
and flung himself upon Barbara.</p>

<p>“I guess I’d better kiss you good-night, Barb’ra,”
he cried. “Just think, I pretty near forgot!”</p>

<p>He beamed shyly upon Jarvis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“Shall I shake hands with you?” he inquired,
with a friendly little smile. “I b’lieve I’d like to.”</p>

<p>Jarvis held out his hand and Jimmy laid his own
in it gravely. Barbara stirred uneasily in her chair.</p>

<p>“Jimmy, dear!” she murmured softly, deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“I never s’posed I’d be shakin’ hands wiv you,”
the child went on calmly. “Did you drive that short-tailed
horse?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jarvis, something swelling strangely
within him as he looked down into the upturned face
of the child, with its candid brown eyes.</p>

<p>“What made you cut his tail off?” demanded
Jimmy. “Peg says it’s a mean trick to cut off
horses’ tails, ’cause they need their tails to brush off
the flies.”</p>

<p>“Jimmy!” called Barbara again, her face crimsoning.</p>

<p>“I didn’t cut it off,” Jarvis replied, with every
evidence of sincerity. “I bought the horse just that
way. I don’t like it myself.”</p>

<p>He glanced at Barbara with a quiet smile.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’m very much in the way,” he said.
“But I wanted to talk with you&mdash;on a matter of
some importance.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">XVII</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">A silence</span>, difficult to break, settled upon the man
and the maid, as Jimmy’s plodding feet toiled up the
stairs.</p>

<p>“Good-night, Barb’ra,” his wistful little voice
called from the top of the stairs.</p>

<p>“Good-night, Jimmy dear,” she answered.</p>

<p>Her eyes, clouded with pain, sought Jarvis’s face.
She had suddenly leaped to the conclusion that he
had come to tell her something concerning the contract;
perhaps to inform her that her prolonged
furlough was at an end.</p>

<p>His next words confirmed this.</p>

<p>“I believe,” he said slowly, “that you are under
bonds to leave your home for a considerable period.
Five years, or thereabouts, to be exact. Am I
right?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” faltered Barbara. She had grown very
pale. “That is why,” she said bravely, “I have
taught Jimmy to go upstairs alone. But he doesn’t
like it&mdash;yet.”</p>

<p>Her eager eyes were fastened upon his face.</p>

<p>“Did you come&mdash;to&mdash;tell me? Must I go&mdash;now?”
she asked.</p>

<p>He waved his hand deprecatingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, no,” he said. “It isn’t that&mdash;exactly. In
fact, I have nothing to do with the matter; only&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He paused, as if to choose his words with care.</p>

<p>“I happen to know the person concerned in the
transaction, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You know him?” breathed Barbara. She leaned
toward him eagerly, the color coming back to her
face in a swift flood. “Then won’t you tell me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’m under bonds to preserve my client’s incognito,”
he said. “But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He looked at her compassionately.</p>

<p>“Are you finding the delay very hard to bear?” he
asked. “Is there&mdash;&mdash;” Again he hesitated. “Is
there any particular reason why you should wish to
know more about the matter?&mdash;any reason why you
cannot wait my client’s pleasure?”</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>“It is that I should like you to tell me,” he went
on deliberately. “I am instructed, by my client&mdash;to
find out&mdash;to&mdash;er&mdash;ascertain, in short, if you are
in any way dissatisfied with the present status of the
affair. If you will be quite frank with me I shall
greatly appreciate your confidence, and so will&mdash;the
person I have the honor to represent. Of this I can
speak very positively.”</p>

<p>“Why,” asked Barbara, her words coming with a
rush, “do I wait at all? If my time is worth&mdash;all
the money your client paid for it&mdash;why am I not
working? That is one thing I want to know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“As to that,” Jarvis said quietly, “I can assure
you that your time is worth all and more than you
receive for it. But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He looked down and fingered his driving gloves
absent-mindedly.</p>

<p>“There have been certain events, transpiring since
the date of your engagement&mdash;your agreement, I
should say better&mdash;with the person of whom we are
speaking, which would seem to indicate that possibly&mdash;mind
I say possibly, I cannot speak certainly
as yet&mdash;but possibly your services may not
be required at all.”</p>

<p>“What must I do? Of course the money&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Naturally, a part of it will be forfeited to you,”
said Jarvis coolly.</p>

<p>To all outward appearance he was the hard-headed
man of affairs discussing a disputed contract.</p>

<p>“I attended to that for you,” he went on. “It
is nothing more than fair, since you still hold
yourself in readiness to fill your part of the contract.”</p>

<p>Barbara was gazing at him with parted lips.</p>

<p>“I chanced to meet an acquaintance of yours this
afternoon,” Jarvis went on, his observant eyes on
her face. “A&mdash;er&mdash;Mr. Whitcomb.”</p>

<p>Her look puzzled him.</p>

<p>“He informed me that he wished to marry you.”</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes sank in shamed confusion.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;said I could not promise until&mdash;unless&mdash;&mdash;”
she faltered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>He arose, gripping his chair-back with tense
fingers.</p>

<p>“It will be impossible to learn the ultimate intentions
of my client at present,” he said.</p>

<p>He continued to look at her as she sat in the soft
radiance of the lamp-light, her head bowed, her slender
hands, browned and roughened by the labors of
sorrowful years, tightly clasped in her lap; and a
great compassion for her friendless youth, her
woman’s tenderness and weakness, swept over him like
a flood. He longed to take her in his arms, to comfort
her unforgotten griefs and forever to shield
her from the coldness of an unfriendly world. She
seemed so slight, so fragile a creature in her thin
dress of faded muslin, with the heavy masses of her
hair knotted low against her slender neck.</p>

<p>“You say you cannot tell me who it is?” she murmured.
“It is so strange not to know&mdash;to wait, being
afraid every day. Why, any time Jimmy might
come home and find me gone.”</p>

<p>Her voice trembled into silence.</p>

<p>He bent toward her, his face transfigured with love
and pity.</p>

<p>“Barbara!” he cried, in a low voice of yearning.</p>

<p>She looked up at him, startled, afraid. He perceived
this, and the next instant his features had resumed
their expression of cold serenity.</p>

<p>“I was about to tell you that any excessive
anxiety on your part is wholly unnecessary,” he said.
“You will certainly be notified at least a week in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
advance. And&mdash;as my client is situated at present&mdash;I
think I may predict with tolerable certainty that
the call will not come before&mdash;autumn.”</p>

<p>Her face brightened.</p>

<p>“In October,” she said, “we shall harvest the
orchards. Then I could pay back the money.”</p>

<p>A swift shadow crossed his face.</p>

<p>“Money; is it of that you must always be thinking?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“You know that I must,” she said proudly. “I
could not rest under so heavy an obligation to&mdash;anyone.”</p>

<p>“No,” he agreed. “I see that&mdash;I understand.”</p>

<p>A melancholy smile touched his lips.</p>

<p>“Do not be alarmed as to the obligation,” he said
quietly. “My client is a man who is accustomed, like
Shylock, to exact the last penny&mdash;even to the pound
of flesh. He will not let you off easily.”</p>

<p>Barbara drew a quick breath.</p>

<p>“It is a man, then?” she asked. “I&mdash;hoped&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You were hoping it was a woman,” he said dryly.
“I have committed an indiscretion in telling you so
much. But&mdash;conceive, if you will, a man, well along
in years, the&mdash;guardian of a child, who requires&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is the child,” asked Barbara, “a boy or girl?”</p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>

<p>“Er&mdash;I cannot tell you as to that. Let us suppose
for the moment that it is a boy.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen the child?”</p>

<p>He looked at her with what she would have called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
in another a bantering tenderness in his deep-set
eyes. In connection with Stephen Jarvis the suggestion
was untenable&mdash;absurd.</p>

<p>“Do you know you are cross-examining me with
considerable adroitness?” he said. “I must be on
my guard, or you will force me to tell you the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.”</p>

<p>“And why should you not tell me the truth?” she
urged. “I think I have the right to know it.”</p>

<p>“Not at present,” he said coolly. “I am in honor
bound to my client, you should remember. I may
lose my&mdash;er&mdash;commission, if I am not careful.”</p>

<p>“I should be glad to know that the child is&mdash;that
he is not an imbecile.”</p>

<p>She answered his amazed look with swift explanation.</p>

<p>“A woman who saw my advertisement wanted me
to take charge of an imbecile child; that is why&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you would have done it, Barbara? You
were ready to commit yourself to such a future, just
because I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped short with a visible effort.</p>

<p>“No; the child is&mdash;&mdash; He is a very dear and lovable
little fellow, I should say. And he needs&mdash;you.
He is&mdash;quite alone in the world.”</p>

<p>“So,” she murmured, “is Jimmy. And when I
am gone there will be no one&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You will not be obliged to leave your brother
right away, you know,” he suggested. “And&mdash;possibly
not at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Her face became illuminated with a sudden inspiration.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t the man&mdash;this client of yours&mdash;bring
the child here for me to take care of? I should
be so glad to have him right away. This is a healthy
spot. I could make him very comfortable.”</p>

<p>Jarvis shook his head.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t like to suggest such a thing,” he said
slowly. “It might savor of impertinence&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Her face crimsoned with mortification.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean&mdash;&mdash;” she stammered.</p>

<p>“Not on your part,” he amended hastily; “understand
me, please. Your idea is&mdash;quite like you; quite
what I should expect, knowing you as I do. But&mdash;I
fear it wouldn’t do. My client&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He must be a peculiar sort of person,” hazarded
Barbara.</p>

<p>“He is,” agreed Jarvis. “So much so that&mdash;I
feel I ought to warn you in one particular.”</p>

<p>Barbara waited in expectant silence.</p>

<p>Jarvis hesitated, studying her downcast face.</p>

<p>“I want you to promise me,” he said slowly, “that
you will not yield to the importunities of&mdash;of Whitcomb.
No; don’t interrupt me. Hear me out. He
will urge you to marry him&mdash;soon. He will tell
you&mdash;&mdash; But you must not listen&mdash;yet. Do you
hear me? You must&mdash;put him off. You must wait&mdash;till&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I shall wait,” she said coldly, “till the man&mdash;your
client&mdash;is satisfied, or paid, in full.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“Will you promise me this?”</p>

<p>She looked him full in the eyes.</p>

<p>“Why should I promise you?” she demanded
haughtily. “I have signed a contract. I am in
honor bound to stand by it. I shall keep my word&mdash;fulfil
the letter of my bond; but not because you
have asked me to do it.”</p>

<p>He turned abruptly and took up his hat.</p>

<p>“That is all I have to say to you,” he said in a
business-like tone.</p>

<p>He stopped, hesitated.</p>

<p>“If I do not see you again&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But you will be obliged to see me,” she objected, “&mdash;to
tell me.”</p>

<p>“No,” he said, and smiled slightly. “I shall not
need to see you again; and&mdash;I may not&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He held out his hand.</p>

<p>“Will you forgive me, Barbara?” he asked
humbly.</p>

<p>“Forgive you?” she echoed.</p>

<p>“God knows I have need of your forgiveness. If
I do not see you again&mdash;and it is quite possible
that I may not. I am thinking of going away, of
closing my house here. I may never return. But
I want&mdash;I need to carry with me the certainty that
you will sometimes think kindly of me. Not that
I deserve it, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>His eyes, dark with pain, searched her face.</p>

<p>“I cannot bear to remember all that has passed
between us. I know now that I was less than a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
to threaten you&mdash;browbeat you, as I did. I hope
you will believe me when I tell you I am hoping for
your best&mdash;your truest, and most lasting happiness.”</p>

<p>His voice, shaken with the solemn passion of renunciation,
died into silence.</p>

<p>She put her hand into his.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;am sorry,” she faltered.</p>

<p>“For what, Barbara?” he asked.</p>

<p>She drew a deep sigh that was half a sob.</p>

<p>“For&mdash;everything,” she said.</p>

<p>Her mouth quivered like a grieving child’s.</p>

<p>“And you do forgive me, Barbara?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>He raised her fingers to his lips.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” he said.</p>

<p>She heard his rapid step on the gravel without, and
later the whir of wheels, faint and fainter in the distance.</p>

<p class="p2">Barbara did not tell David all that had passed
between Jarvis and herself, when on the following
day he unburdened himself of the multiplied conjecture
and complaints which had occurred to him
since his briefly renewed acquaintance with the lawyer.
In some uncomprehended way their past had acquired
a new significance in Barbara’s eyes, almost sacred
in the light of Jarvis’s difficult confession. As she
had, through some deep, delicate instinct, hidden her
early romance from Jarvis, she now shielded from
David’s scrutiny his rival’s unavailing passion and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
pain. David would not understand, she knew; he
would laugh and toss his handsome head, secure in
his own easily won triumph.</p>

<p>“I suspected the old fox knew more than he owned
up to me, though when I taxed him with it he was
ready to lie out of it,” David said.</p>

<p>He drew Barbara to him and kissed her carelessly
full on the mouth. Then when she would have withdrawn
herself from his arms, he laughed, and held her
strongly to him, looking deep into her eyes.</p>

<p>“You don’t want to get away from me,” he said.
“You are mine; didn’t you know that?”</p>

<p>He kissed her a dozen times, hotly, eagerly, holding
her breathless, crushed against his breast, releasing
her at last, flushed and tremulous, her heavy hair
loosened on her neck.</p>

<p>David watched her with amused eyes, as she restored
the hairpins to place, following the curving
lines of her young figure appreciatively.</p>

<p>“You need some handsome gowns, Barbara, to set
off your good looks,” he said. “You’ll have them,
too, when you’re my wife.”</p>

<p>He took her hand.</p>

<p>“I’ll wager you’ve been wondering why I didn’t
bring you a ring,” he went on exuberantly. “Girls
always like rings, and I see you don’t wear anything
but that plain one. Here, I’ll&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t take it off,” implored Barbara. “It was
my mother’s. It was her wedding ring.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, dear. But you must take it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
off, just the same. You can wear it on the other
hand, if you like&mdash;or put it away; a keepsake
like that is best locked up in some box. I’ll give
you all the rings you’ll need to wear from now
on.”</p>

<p>He snapped open a tiny case of white velvet and
flashed its imbedded jewel in her averted eyes.</p>

<p>“Do you like it, dear? Do you think it’s pretty?
I couldn’t get anything decent in this hole, of course,
so I sent to the city for it. It just came by express,
last night. I found it when I got back from my delightful
ride with that old crab, Jarvis.”</p>

<p>“It&mdash;it’s beautiful, David, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I hope it’ll fit; let me put it on, dearest.”</p>

<p>“David&mdash;I&mdash;can’t; don’t you see&mdash;I am not free
to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What in Heaven’s name are you talking about?
Aren’t we engaged?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;don’t know,” the girl said slowly. “No,&mdash;not
till fall. You mustn’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Damn old Jarvis, if he’s been putting any such
notions into your head!” cried David. “Why, Barbara,
you’re talking nonsense. Didn’t he tell you
you could get a release? I’ll buy the fellow off. I
told Jarvis I would.”</p>

<p>“You told him?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, I did. And I mean to. We’ll be
married by that time. Now, don’t say <i>no</i>. Just give
me a show to prove what ought to need no urging on
my part to make you see. If we are married hard and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
fast there’ll be no back talk coming from Jarvis or
anybody else. Can’t you see that, dear? I dare say
the fellow is only waiting for a good excuse to demand
his money back, and we’ll give it to him. Come,
sweetheart, let me put this ring on your dear little
finger, and next month I’ll add another of a different
sort. Then I’ll be in a position to talk business with
old Jarvis, or his client, whoever he is. I’ll say,
‘Here’s your money, sir,’ short and sharp; ‘take
it or leave it, as suits you best. My wife doesn’t go
out to service with any man.’ That’s my sensible
girl!”</p>

<p>He would have drawn her again into his arms. But
she resisted him tensely.</p>

<p>“You don’t understand, David, and you must
understand,” she said slowly. “I&mdash;promised I
wouldn’t&mdash;till&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You promised! Who in the devil did you promise?
You promised me, and I’m going to hold you
to it.”</p>

<p>“No; not till after I was bound, and I&mdash;only
promised you conditionally. Don’t you remember,
David?”</p>

<p>“I only remember what I choose to remember,” he
said superciliously. “And all I know, or care to
know, at the present moment, is that you’re mine&mdash;mine,
Barbara! Haven’t I waited for years and suffered&mdash;Barbara!”</p>

<p>His voice vibrated with passion; he reached out
for her hungrily, irresistibly, and held her fast in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the clasp of one powerful arm, while with the other
he sought for her elusive hand.</p>

<p>“One finger is just as good as another for me,” he
laughed as he slipped the ring into place. “There!
Isn’t that handsome?”</p>

<p>But she hid her troubled eyes against his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Not on my ugly brown hand, David,” she murmured.
“And I cannot wear it&mdash;yet. I promised.”</p>

<p>“That’s twice you’ve mentioned the fact that you
promised,” he said, scowling. “Did Jarvis have the
brazen nerve to come between you and me with any
of his cut and dried legal business?”</p>

<p>“He&mdash;reminded me of my contract. He said&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll fix that up with Jarvis. Say, do you
know he makes me tired? I told him we were engaged,
and if he had any such line of talk to pass out
he might have come to me. I’m the one for him to do
business with from now on, and I’ll let him know it,
too.”</p>

<p>He released her, suddenly.</p>

<p>“You can do as you like about the ring,” he said in
an offended tone. “Most girls would jump at the
chance to wear a two-hundred-dollar diamond. I’ll
chuck it into the waste-basket, if you say so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, David!” breathed Barbara, “did you spend
all that money&mdash;just for me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did; and I supposed you’d be pleased. I
never dreamed you’d refuse to wear it.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;it isn’t that I don’t love you,” she faltered.
“Indeed I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, if you love me, you’ll do as I say,” interrupted
David, with an arrogant toss of his handsome
head. “Will you, Barbara?”</p>

<p>“I will in everything but&mdash;you know, dear, I&mdash;I
can’t.”</p>

<p>He stared at her in angry silence.</p>

<p>“You appear a soft enough little thing,” he said
at last, “but you’re as infernally obstinate as&mdash;&mdash; Here,
give me the ring. I’ll not force it on you.”</p>

<p>She slipped it from her finger in silence, and he
took it, restored it to its velvet nest, and dropped
the case in his pocket.</p>

<p>“The next time I ask you to wear that ring,” he
said, “you’ll either do it, or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“David!” cried Barbara faintly. “Please&mdash;please
don’t be angry. Try to&mdash;understand.”</p>

<p>“Try to understand&mdash;eh? Well, I’m not so dull
as some; but you’ve got me stumped all right. Maybe
that’s what you’re trying to do.”</p>

<p>She put out her hands to him pleadingly. But he
did not choose to see them.</p>

<p>“I’ll talk with Jarvis,” he said roughly. “And
in the meantime you keep away from him. Just let me
manage for a while. A woman isn’t up to business,
anyway. Why, it makes me hot to think of his
coming here and talking you to a finish the way he
did. I wish I’d caught him at it, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“David!” Barbara’s voice was low and urgent.
“I wish you wouldn’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>She clung to his arm; but his look did not soften.</p>

<p>“Please don’t&mdash;say anything to Mr. Jarvis. He&mdash;meant
to be kind. He&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>David turned suddenly and caught her by the
shoulders.</p>

<p>“See here,” he said. “I’m beginning to see a
glimmer of light through this particular millstone.
Is <i>Jarvis</i> the man who tried to get you to marry him
while I was away? Answer me!”</p>

<p>“He asked&mdash;me&mdash;to marry him, and I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>David burst into a great laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, well!” he cried, “that was a conquest.
Old Jarvis, of all men! Why, Barb, you’re a wonder.
Ha, ha!”</p>

<p>She trembled before his loud laughter as she had
not beneath the weight of his displeasure.</p>

<p>David suddenly became grave, his brows drawn in
thought.</p>

<p>“That puts a different face on things,” he said.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">XVIII</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">Hewett’s</span> general store, with its official annex, the
post-office, occupied a prominent place in the social
as well as the economic system of Barford. Not
even the aisles, sheds, and steps of the Presbyterian
church afforded so convenient and popular an arena
for the interchange of items of general interest as did
“Hewett’s.” There appeared to be something suggestively
cheerful and enlivening in the sagging piles
of fruit and vegetables, something friendly and hospitable
in the boxes, barrels, and kegs open to public
inspection and exploring fingers. Even the curious
and all-pervasive odor compounded of prunes, pickles,
yellow soap, and tobacco, with an occasional aromatic
whiff of freshly ground coffee, seemed to lend itself
to a pleasantly open frame of mind, conducive
to an unreserved expression of opinion concerning
the church, the state, and the social whirl, as evidenced
in the varying currents and eddies of village
life.</p>

<p>As in other similar emporiums devoted to the
display and sale of such commodities as were in general
demand “the store cat” might be seen guarding
inconspicuous rat-holes, or curled up in peaceful
slumber in the cracker barrel, or in close proximity
to the whity-brown loaves of bread destined for private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
consumption and handled with easy familiarity
and a total lack of ceremonial cleanliness by the
driver of the baker’s cart, the Hewetts, father and
son, and by such tentative customers as elected to
test the freshness of the product with doubtful thumb
and finger.</p>

<p>It was at Hewett’s, as might have been expected,
that the singular event of the auction at the Preston
farm had been discussed in all its different aspects.
The amount of the mortgage held by Stephen Jarvis,
the various expedients resorted to by the daughter
of Donald Preston, and the events leading up to her
desperate and successful coup had all been reviewed
circumstantially and in order. The continued presence
of David Whitcomb in the community furnished
a welcome variation to the subject; and inasmuch as
David was found not averse to talking of himself,
there was little mystery about his return to Barford
and its object.</p>

<p>Opinions as to the personal appearance, probable
resources, and moral character of the ex-schoolmaster
were found to be as varied as the new and
somewhat showy raiment in which he appeared from
day to day.</p>

<p>“Thinks he’s too good to walk now ’t he’s got
them shiny pointed shoes,” observed Hank Smith,
whose footgear was of the square-toed variety, presumably
inherited from a deceased relative. “I
seen him drivin’ a rig out t’ Preston’s to-day.”</p>

<p>“Yas,” corroborated the local liveryman. “He’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
took it b’ the week. Says he’s thinkin’ of buyin’ a
good horse.”</p>

<p>“Huh! you don’t say,” drawled a farmer from the
hills, who had dropped in for his week’s supply of
groceries and his mail. “I s’pose he done pretty
well out west? Mebbe I c’d sell him that bay mare o’
mine.”</p>

<p>“He spen’s lots of money; I don’t know how much
he’s got,” was the unchallenged opinion put forth by
another.</p>

<p>There followed a general oscillation of heads about
the empty stove, a round-bellied affair, capable of
fierce white heats in the winter time, but abandoned
to rust in summer and habitually diffusing a clammy
scent of chimney soot and damp ashes.</p>

<p>“I guess the’ don’t anybody know ’s t’ that; I
heard him speak o’ minin’ prop’ties kind o’ careless
like. He sure does carry a big wad.”</p>

<p>“The table board over t’ the Eagle’s called pretty
fair; but ’tain’t good enough fer Whitcomb. He
pays extry fer dinner at night.”</p>

<p>“Jus’ so; an’ Sutton’s cook left after he’d been
thar a couple o’ weeks. She said she wa’n’t a-goin’
t’ put up with Whitcomb.”</p>

<p>“Wall, I’ll give that young feller about four
months t’ run through what he’s got,” the elder
Hewett observed, in the intervals of passing various
purchases of coffee through his grinder. “I’ll bet
I c’d carry all the minin’ prop’ty he owns in m’
vest pocket, an’ hev room fer m’ han’kerchief.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Twon’t take him that long if he keeps on as he’s
goin’ now. I heerd”&mdash;and the speaker leaned forward,
bringing the legs of his chair to the floor with
a thump&mdash;“‘at he’s pretty fast; drinks consid’ble
an’ plays cards fer money. Wonder if she knows?”</p>

<p>“Barb’ry’d ought t’ look out, if he’s that kind,”
observed another, wagging his pendulous chin-whiskers.
“Her pa’d ought t’ be a serious warnin’
t’ her.”</p>

<p>“Shaw! ’tain’t so,” put in a third. “Dave’s all
right. He ain’t so slow’s to be actually mossy; but
he’s all right. I’ll bet you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>What the speaker was about to wager on his charitable
opinion was lost to the public as Peg Morrison
stubbed noisily up the steps, and entered the door,
swung hospitably wide to dust, flies, and the travelling
public.</p>

<p>“Hello, Peg; how’s your folks?” drawled Al
Hewett, presenting his round, solemn face at the
square aperture devoted to the delivery of mail. “Le’
me see; here’s a paper fer you, an’ a circ’lar,&mdash;one
o’ them phosphate ads you’ve been gettin’ lately.
An’ a letter fer Miss Barb’ra. Do you want I should
forward it&mdash;eh?”</p>

<p>“Forward it&mdash;no; give it t’ me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morrison’s voice held an exasperated note discouraging
to those in quest of information.</p>

<p>“Then she ain’t left yet?” queried an individual,
comfortably seated over the cool recesses of the pickle
barrel. “Somebody was sayin’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Peg, facing about and addressing
the inquiring circle of eyes as one man. “No, sir;
Miss Barb’ry ain’t gone, an’ as fer ’s I know,
she’ll be home, anyhow, till after the apples is
picked.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morrison would have warmly disclaimed any
intention of discussing his mistress’s business with
outsiders; but he felt it incumbent upon himself, as
the surviving feudal representative, as it were,
of the Preston family, to correct erroneous public
opinion.</p>

<p>“Goin’ t’ gether a pretty fair crop this year, I
see,” observed the village veterinary, who combined
the business of livery and sale stable with his more
learned profession.</p>

<p>“You bet,” chuckled Peg. “W’y, them apples ’ll
beat anythin’ in the county. We’re goin’ t’ exhibit at
th’ fair, same ’s we ust to.”</p>

<p>“Apples is goin’ t’ be so cheap y’ can’t git nothin’
fer ’em,” said a farmer pessimistically. “Ef they
don’t all drop off the trees come September, it’s bein’
s’ dry.”</p>

<p>“Our apples won’t drop, I’ll bet you,” bragged
Peg. “We’ve kep’ th’ ground in our orchards
ploughed an’ cultivated all summer. Miss Barb’ry,
she kind o’ got that notion las’ spring f’om readin’
some gov’ment report, an’ jus’ to humor her I done
’s she said.”</p>

<p>“‘Tain’t no way to do,” put in another. “The
grass prevents th’ roots f’om heavin’; keeps ’em cool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
in summer an’ warm in winter. Y’ don’t ketch me
payin’ any ’tention to them blamed gov’ment reports.
Now the Republicans is in, y’ can’t b’lieve a word ’at
comes f’om Washin’ton.”</p>

<p>No one being immediately minded to disprove this
sweeping statement, there was brief silence for a
space. Then a new topic was introduced.</p>

<p>“Say, Peleg, when’s the weddin’ comin’ off to your
place?”</p>

<p>“The weddin’? what weddin’?” parried Peg cautiously.
“I ain’t heerd o’ no weddin’.”</p>

<p>“You hain’t&mdash;heh? Well, you’re kind o’ behind
the times.”</p>

<p>“I heerd the’ was to be two weddin’s out your way
come fall,” cackled the horse doctor. “How ’bout
Marthy an’ th’ onions?”</p>

<p>Peg turned an angrily bewildered face upon the
speaker.</p>

<p>“Th’ onions,” he said, “is O. K.; but I dunno
what you’re drivin’ at.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell ye; Marthy Cottle told Elviry
Scott, an’ she tol’ my wife’s sister that you was
payin’ her marked attention. She said she hadn’t
made up her mind whether t’ marry ye or not. But
she thought mebbe she might, ef the onion crop turned
out all right. I sez t’ m’ wife&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A roar of laughter drowned the end of the sentence
and Peg’s indignant denial.</p>

<p>“I ain’t done no more,” he averred, “than t’ wipe
m’ feet careful on th’ door-mat on the kitchen-stoop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
when the’s mud on the groun’. An’ I only done that
t’ keep th’ peace.”</p>

<p>“Wall, Peleg, ef you c’n make out t’ keep th’
peace with Marthy Cottle, I reckon you’re the man
fer Marthy,” was the opinion of the senior Hewett,
delivered over the top of a tall bag of sugar which
he was weighing.</p>

<p>A chorus of loud laughter greeted this sally; when
it had died away a late comer announced impersonally
that the county fair was going to be the
finest in years.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” confirmed a visitor from the county
seat, distant some five miles. “The’ll be horses f’om
all over the state, ’n a b’lloon ascension, b’sides the
usual features.”</p>

<p>“Any races?” inquired the farmer from the upper
hill road. “‘Cause I’ve got a colt, Black Hawk
blood, ’t c’n run like a streak o’ greased lightnin’.”</p>

<p>“Races? Well, natu’ally. The’ll be races every
day after the fust, an’ on Sat’day, the closin’ day,
the stakes ’ll be a hunderd dollars fer two-year-olds,
an’ up fer hosses o’ all ages. I wouldn’t miss it fer
more’n I gen’ally carry in loose change. The’ll be
some tall bettin’, I persoom.”</p>

<p>“They say that young Whitcomb feller’s quite a
sport when ’t comes t’ puttin’ money on any ol’
thing,” drawled young Hewett, who had laid aside
his official gravity as he emerged from behind the
post-office.</p>

<p>Mr. Morrison looked troubled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess I’ll be goin’ ’long,” he said, and cast a
defiant look around the circle. “Ef I was you,” he
said, “I’d keep my mouth shet ’bout things I didn’t
know anythin’ ’bout.”</p>

<p>No one answered; but there was a general laugh
as his heavy boots were heard to strike the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“Poor old Peleg!” said one. “Them Prestons has
kep’ him pretty busy cookin’ up excuses. An’ ef she
marries Whitcomb I guess Peleg ’ll be up against it
a while longer.”</p>

<p>“‘Twon’t be any time b’fore Jarvis gits another
mortgage; mebbe he’ll fetch it this time. ’Tain’t
often the ’onor’ble gent gits left. I hed t’ laugh when
I heerd she’d paid him off.”</p>

<p>“The’s somethin’ mighty queer ’bout that business,
anyhow. Who d’ye suppose anted up with the
money?”</p>

<p>“Some fool, like ’s not. A fool an’ his money’s
soon parted. Now like’s not it was Dave Whitcomb.
Mebbe he&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Get out, man! What’d be the use o’ that, if
he’s goin’ t’ marry her?”</p>

<p>“He wa’n’t engaged to her when he fust come
back; mebbe he thought&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Thought nothin’! Dave wouldn’t pass over no
four thousand dollars b’fore he knew she’d have him,
would he? He’d be a bigger fool ’n he looks to do
that.”</p>

<p>“Say, Hank,” drawled young Hewett, “which ’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
you druther be, a bigger fool ’n you look? or look a
bigger fool ’n you be?”</p>

<p>“I dunno,” said Hank, thoughtfully expectorating
in the general direction of the rusty stove. “Guess
on the hull, I’d ruther look a bigger fool ’n I be,
b’cause&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s impossible!” quoth the genial Al, with
a snigger of amusement.</p>

<p>“Pooh! that’s a dried-up chestnut, Hank,” interposed
the liveryman, “f’om five years b’fore last;
don’t you let Al get a rise out o’ you that easy. He’d
’a’ said the same thing whichever way you’d answered.”</p>

<p>“Darn!” vociferated Hank. Then he joined in
the general laugh.</p>

<p>In the silence that followed the subsidence of mirth
a small, spare individual, wearing a gray linen duster,
buttoned to the throat, and carrying a suit-case and
tightly strapped umbrella, entered the store. He
gazed inquiringly at the assembled circle, his eyes
wrinkling pleasantly at the corners.</p>

<p>“I just blew in,” he observed to nobody in particular,
“and I’m going to hang out for a few days at
the best hotel in town.”</p>

<p>“The’ ain’t but one,” volunteered the voluble
Smith, stealthily moving his chair that he might get
a look at the stranger’s feet. They were neatly covered
with tan Oxfords, he satisfied himself; but the
toes were not pointed.</p>

<p>“Where’ll I find it?” asked the stranger. “I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
an inspector from the Phœnix Fire Insurance Company,”
he added, correctly interpreting the suspicious
glances levelled at him and his sparse belongings.
“Expect to be in town two or three days,
looking over our risks and correcting a map of the
town. I do a little life insurance business on the
side.”</p>

<p>“Takin’ on any new risks in buildin’s?” inquired
the man on the pickle barrel.</p>

<p>“W’y, yes; I ain’t a regular soliciting agent for
the Phœnix; but I’ll be mighty glad to write any
persons desiring insurance,” replied the stranger.
“My name,” he added pleasantly, “is Todd, Albert
Todd, at your service, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>Mr. Todd bowed and smiled expansively.</p>

<p>“Wall, ye want t’ cast yer eye over Hiram Plumb’s
prop’ty, fust thing you do,” advised the liveryman,
with a facetious grimace toward the individual on
the pickle barrel. “It’s in a fierce condition.”</p>

<p>The gentleman in question slowly descended from
his perch, thoughtfully caressing the seat of his
trousers, as he replied in kind.</p>

<p>“Y’ don’t hev to worry none ’bout me, Mister
Todd&mdash;if that’s your name&mdash;I don’t insure in the
Phœnix; but Bud Hawley, him that keeps the liv’ry-stable,
is a teetotally bad risk. He’s been takin’
au-to-mo-beels t’ board lately, an’ they sure do kick
up a powerful smell o’ gasolene.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a permit,” hastily interposed Mr. Hawley.
“I c’n show it to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>The stranger waved his hand deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” he said gently. “I have
nothing to do with that class of business. But if
Mr. Hawley has a good horse and buggy to hire, I’ll
be glad to talk business. How about it, Mr. Hawley?”</p>

<p>Mr. Hawley favored the stranger with a comprehensive
stare.</p>

<p>“Guess I got a rig ’at ’ud suit,” he admitted.
“Fi’ dollars a day an’ up, ’cordin’ t’ the sort o’ rig
you’re lookin’ for.”</p>

<p>“I want,” said Mr. Todd, “a good smart horse;
one that can cover considerable territory in a day,
and a buggy; nothing fancy, you know; but neat
and comfortable.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Mr. Hawley slowly. “I’m goin’
along t’ my place now; ’tain’t fur from the
Eagle.”</p>

<p>“Many folks stopping at the hotel?” inquired
Mr. Todd briskly, as the two men walked along the
village street under the heavy noonday shade of the
big maples.</p>

<p>“Not s’ many,” replied the liveryman non-committally.</p>

<p>He scowled as a smart, yellow-wheeled trap whizzed
past.</p>

<p>“I dunno what sort of a driver you be,” he said.
“Most anybody wants t’ git over the ground these
days; but the’s some folks ’at thinks they c’n drive
a horse like it was an automobeel. That’s one o’ my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
rigs an’ one o’ my best horses,&mdash;or was till that chap
took t’ drivin’ it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Todd stretched his long neck after the yellow-wheeled
trap, which had stopped in front of the Barford
Eagle a little further up the street.</p>

<p>“You don’t say!” he observed mildly. “Kind of
a young feller, too. They say a merciful man is
merciful to his beast.”</p>

<p>“Dave Whitcomb must be a hard case, ’cordin’
to that,” was Mr. Hawley’s opinion. “Y’ seen
him get out an’ go in; did you? Wall, that young
chap used t’ teach school here. Fact; he was principal
of our union school, an’ considered a smart
enough chap, though quiet; didn’t cut much of a
swathe, even with the young folks. But all of a
sudden he up an’ went west! an’ we heard after a
spell he was dead. But he turned up a while ago,
live as ever, an’ consid’able changed. He’s quite a
heavy swell now; they say he owns a mine, or suthin’,
out west. He’s stayin’ t’ the Eagle; ’n’ say, if
you’re one of the sort ’at likes t’ put on style ’n’ eat
your dinner at night mebbe you c’d chum in with
Dave.”</p>

<p>“What’s the young man’s line of business?” asked
Mr. Todd. “I’d like to interest him in a little
proposition&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Business?” echoed Mr. Hawley, and he chuckled
as he drove his hands a little deeper into his trousers
pockets. “Dave’s principal business around these
parts is courtin’, I sh’d say. I guess he don’t do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
much else these days. Girl out in the country; got
a big apple farm. If you git acquainted with Dave
he’ll tell you all about it.”</p>

<p>To make the acquaintance of the ex-schoolmaster
appeared to be exactly what the energetic Mr. Todd
was seeking. He put up at the Eagle, where he
made a point of asking for a six o’clock dinner.</p>

<p>“I am told,” he said to Sutton, the proprietor,
“that this is one of the few properly managed hotels
in this part of the country, with evening dinners,
breakfasts <i>à la carte</i>, and so forth!”</p>

<p>Sutton silently shook his heavy body, his wide
mouth turning up at the comers, an exercise which
passed with him as a laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” he said, “we’re stylish an’ up t’ date
all right, when it comes t’ ’leven o’clock breakfasts
an’ six o’clock dinners. We’ve kind of changed our
day around here t’ ’commodate our patrons. We
calc’late t’ please.”</p>

<p>And so it came about that young Whitcomb sat
down to dinner that night with Mr. Albert Todd.
The latter individual was quite the gentleman in his
manners at table, David observed. Little by little
the two fell into friendly conversation, and David, at
first irritable and silent, passed all at once into his
alternating mood, when he desired nothing so much as
to talk about himself. He had found few he cared
to talk to in Barford, except Barbara, and there
were things one could not mention to a woman.</p>

<p>Not once did the tactful Mr. Todd allude to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
subject of life insurance, and he appeared wonderfully
interested in David’s account of his life in the
West; of his failures, few and far between, and of
his successes, social and otherwise which, according
to David, had been many and remarkable. Mr.
Todd was a man of the world, that much was clear,
with no foolish or fanatical prejudices. After dinner
the two in a state of post-prandial amity strolled
across to the barroom, where they partook of various
cooling drinks, compounded, under David’s direction,
by the alert young person behind the bar. And
when later they strolled out to the piazza and David
produced cigarettes, they had fallen into relations of
such exceeding friendliness that David reopened the
conversation in a more intimate tone than he had yet
taken.</p>

<p>“This is the most confoundedly stupid hole a man
ever dropped into,” he observed through the fragrant
smoke wreaths.</p>

<p>“It looks kind of peaceful and soothing,” agreed
Mr. Todd, with a chuckle; “I guess I can stand it
for a few days, though.”</p>

<p>He looked away up the dusty street where an occasional
pedestrian enlivened the solitude. “Thinking
of settling here?” he asked.</p>

<p>David scowled.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “Out in the country a mile or so.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll have hopes of striking the metropolis
here occasionally?” queried Mr. Todd facetiously.
“I wouldn’t want to get too far away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>David’s eyes were still fixed and frowning.</p>

<p>“What do you think of a man of my experience
settling down in a place like this to raise apples?”
he asked. “Sometimes I think I’m several kinds of
a fool for doing it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Todd spat thoughtfully over the rail.</p>

<p>“That depends,” he said tentatively, but with a
keen look at the other.</p>

<p>David flicked the ash off his cigarette, then flung
it impatiently away and lighted a fresh one.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” he said; “but take it anyway
you like, is the game worth the candle? Once I’m
tied up here, I suppose I’ll have to stand by the rest
of my life. Do I want to do it? Would you want
to do it? Honest now.”</p>

<p>The small spare gentleman who had introduced
himself to Barford society under the name of Albert
Todd smiled thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Well, it strikes me as a bit slow for my taste.
What do you say to a game of cards to pass away
the time?”</p>

<p>David shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t take much to cards,” he said. “The other
chap generally wins, and I like to be on the winning
side.”</p>

<p>He tramped up and down the piazza a few times;
impatiently kicking at the railings as he paused to
turn.</p>

<p>“There’s a man in this town I’ve got to see on
rather disagreeable business,” he said at last. “I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
been putting it off for several days; but I believe I’ll
do it now. So long. See you in the morning.”</p>

<p>Left to himself Mr. Todd elevated his feet to the
railing, as if to indulge in a prolonged period of post-prandial
meditation. In the gathering twilight he
watched David’s muscular figure swinging along the
street. He was walking like a man with a purpose.
After a minute or two of keen-eyed watchfulness Mr.
Todd quietly arose, clapped his hat on his head, and
strolled toward the steps.</p>

<p>“Goin’ out t’ take in the town?” inquired a voice
from the rear.</p>

<p>The insurance man glanced at the slim youth in the
rather untidy white apron who stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>“W’y, yes,” he replied, very pleasantly indeed.
“I thought I might as well.”</p>

<p>“I’d advise you not to have much to do with that
fellow you was talkin’ to,” pursued the youth sulkily.
“He’s one of our customers, but I don’t care. Talk
’bout cards; he cleaned me out of a month’s wages one
night last week; then laughed at me for bein’ mad.
I ain’t got no use fer him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” Mr. Todd said pacifically.
“He seems like a nice sort. Nothing really
vicious, or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He’s a durned, good-fer-nothin’ blowhard; that’s
what he is,” said the bartender rancorously. “An’
that’s what I tell Jennie. But she&mdash;&mdash; I’d like t’
punch his head; that’s all!”</p>

<p>“Who’s Jennie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“She waited on your table t’ supper. She’s the
prettiest girl in this town.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Mr. Todd understandingly.</p>

<p>“She’s prettier ’n that Preston girl ever thought
of bein’&mdash;that’s his girl. He’s engaged t’ her. But
some folks want the earth.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” observed Mr. Todd smilingly. “And
sometimes,” he added, with a wink, “they get it,
too!”</p>

<p>This speech appeared to irritate the youth exceedingly.
“Huh!” he exploded violently. “Well,
I’d like to punch his head; that’s all.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">XIX</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">David’s</span> suddenly formed resolution carried him
swiftly to the one big house of the village, where he
rang the bell. The night being warm the outer door
stood open and he could look through the screen into
the dimly lighted hall. To the left of the passage was
Jarvis’s library, and David, waiting impatiently before
the outer door, perceived that the master of the
house was within, quietly reading by a shaded lamp.
Somehow the sight stirred the unreasoning anger
within him to a hotter glow. His unanswered summons
appeared in the guise of a deliberate insult.
Raising his walking-stick he smote the door. He
saw the man within raise his eyes from his book,
as if to listen, and repeated his knock smartly; then
as Jarvis rose and came hastily toward the door, he
spoke:</p>

<p>“Good-evening, Mr. Jarvis,” he said, mumbling
the prefix so that it was little more than an inarticulate
sound. “Guess your door-bell isn’t in working
order.”</p>

<p>Jarvis recognized his visitor with an involuntary
start, which David perceived with ill-disguised
triumph.</p>

<p>“The fellow’s afraid of me,” he told himself, and
hung up his hat on the rack as if quite at his ease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>He followed Jarvis into the library and sat down,
looking about him with cool curiosity.</p>

<p>“You’ve been expecting to see me, I dare say,” he
began, his eyes returning from their tour of inspection
to the other man’s face.</p>

<p>Jarvis returned the look doubtfully.</p>

<p>“It occurred to me that you might wish&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes; I do,” interrupted David. “You’re entirely
right, sir.”</p>

<p>Having said this much in a loud, aggressive tone,
David stopped short. He had become suddenly aware
that Jarvis was looking at&mdash;or rather, through&mdash;him,
in a way which made him irritably conscious of his
hands, his feet, the set of his collar, and the material
of his light summer clothes. Then those strange eyes
went deeper; they were busying themselves with his
thoughts, his motives, they even saw his fears, which
crowded forward, a cloud of gibbering shapes, out of
his past.</p>

<p>He spoke again, hurriedly, and backed up his words
with a laugh, which sounded foolishly loud in the quiet
room.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “now that you’ve had time to
look me over, how d’ you like me? Think I’ll do&mdash;eh?”</p>

<p>“No,” Jarvis said quietly, almost sadly. “I’m
afraid not. But I don’t intend to trust my own judgment&mdash;entirely.”</p>

<p>He sighed deeply and looked down, as if there was
nothing more to be seen or said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>David straightened himself in his chair with a jerk.</p>

<p>“See here,” he said truculently. “I was joking,
you know; you were staring at me as if you’d never
seen a human being before. But now I’d like you to
answer me straight. What d’you mean by saying I
‘won’t do’? What business is it of yours what
I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He choked a little with the rage that was consuming
him.</p>

<p>“Why, confound your impudence!” he cried, his
face flaming with anger.</p>

<p>“I owe you an apology, sir,” said Jarvis, with
stately composure. “I ought not to have spoken as
I did. But there is much at stake.”</p>

<p>“Not for you,” said David insolently.</p>

<p>He fell to staring at Jarvis, striving to imitate the
other’s disconcerting look.</p>

<p>“She loves me, you know.”</p>

<p>He had not intended to taunt his rival, but the
words slipped out without volition. He was glad of
it, in view of the blighting change that swept over
the other’s face.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Jarvis said dully, “I know that.”</p>

<p>He was realizing all at once that the blow that
felled Whitcomb must reach her tender breast also.</p>

<p>“There’s no use of beating about the bush,” David
went on. “She told me about your visit to her the
other night. At first I didn’t catch on about that
remarkable client of yours and the care of the interesting
child and all that. But when I got out of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the fact that you had been courting her while I was
away, of course I was on to your little game.”</p>

<p>He paused to allow his words their full weight,
exulting in the look of quiet despair that appeared to
have settled upon Jarvis’s face.</p>

<p>“You thought if you couldn’t catch and hold her
one way you would another. You planned to keep
her from me! Deny it if you dare!”</p>

<p>Jarvis looked up, opened his lips as if minded to
reply; then his head drooped, and again he sighed
deeply. He was striving to master himself; that self
which even now struggled like a leashed hound under
his iron hand.</p>

<p>“I must be fair,” he groaned half aloud. “I
must&mdash;I must, for her sake.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” inquired David smartly. “We
may as well have it out first as last, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Jarvis, rousing himself. “I didn’t
mean to&mdash;yet. But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He looked calmly at David.</p>

<p>“Can we not talk this over in a reasonable way?”
he asked. “There is really no need of anger or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, man; let’s get down to business!” cried
David, vastly pleased with himself and his own
acumen.</p>

<p>He had not been at all certain as to the money,
which he was now convinced Jarvis had given Barbara
out of his own pocket. That he had surprised,
compelled, browbeaten Jarvis, in what he was pleased
to call “the fellow’s own game,” was a matter for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
pride, exultation. Who was Jarvis, anyway, that a
whole countryside should stand in awe of him and
his achievements? He, Whitcomb, had met the man
and conquered him on his own ground. He even
began to feel a sort of complacent pity for his
abased rival, as his spirits rose from the depths of
the humiliation falsely put upon him by Jarvis.</p>

<p>“‘You can fool some of the people all of the
time,’ you know,” he quoted, with a confident laugh;
“and you did succeed in fooling Barbara nicely; but
the minute I heard you were in love with her, of
course I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“One thing first,” interrupted Jarvis; “did she
tell you&mdash;what had passed between us of her own
free will?”</p>

<p>David burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s where the shoe pinches, is it?” he said
good-humoredly. “Well, I don’t mind informing
you that Barbara didn’t tell me a single thing about
you&mdash;not at first. She’s a good little scout, Barbie
is, and she saved your pride all right for you. She’d
never have told me, I guess; but I taxed her with it,
and, of course, she couldn’t deny it. Some girls would
have snapped you up quick, with all your money and
everything, and with me supposedly buried up in the
Klondyke. But not Barbara. She’s worth while,
that girl.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” mused Jarvis, “she is&mdash;worth while.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t catch me loafing around this dead
and alive hole for many women,” David went on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
drumming with his fingers on the edge of his chair.
“As it is, I’ve had about all I can stand of it; and she
won’t give in and marry me&mdash;won’t even wear my
ring, till that client of yours&mdash;that peculiar, hard-to-get-along-with
individual you’re representing&mdash;can
be either bought off, or disposed of in some way.
Naturally, neither of us want to be under obligations
to&mdash;<i>you</i>!” he finished dramatically.</p>

<p>“Does she&mdash;suppose that I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>David laughed again.</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “Oh, no! Barbie isn’t gifted
with a very keen imagination. She swallowed all you
told her about that singular, out-of-town client of
yours. She seems to have implicit faith in you.”</p>

<p>A subtle lightning flash leaped from Jarvis’s eyes.</p>

<p>“She’s quite right to trust me,” he said calmly.
“I’ll be glad if you can do the same.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now, it’s too late for any more joking
between us!” cried David roughly. “You can’t
pull the wool over my eyes. You gave her that
money, Jarvis, you know you did. And you did it
just so as to tie her down. It’s a damned shame!”</p>

<p>Jarvis had risen, and David sprang eagerly from
his chair to face him. The two men were of equal
height, and for an instant David’s boyish blue eyes
strove to master Jarvis, glance to glance. Then he
drew back, baffled, furious.</p>

<p>“You aren’t going to stick to that cock-and-bull
story a minute longer with me,” he blustered. “You
know very well where the money came from!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>Jarvis bowed ceremoniously.</p>

<p>“Certainly I know,” he acknowledged.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you give it to her?”</p>

<p>“I shall not answer you.”</p>

<p>“Well, you did, and I can prove it.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>David sprang forward with a triumphant laugh
and snatched a small object from the desk.</p>

<p>“I have been sitting where I could look at your
writing traps,” he exulted. “And I saw&mdash;this!”</p>

<p>Jarvis appeared quite unmoved.</p>

<p>“That is my seal,” he observed, “with my family
crest. What of it?”</p>

<p>“What of it?” shouted David. “Why, it’s the
thing that was used to sign that damned contract.
It’s proof positive. That’s what it is!”</p>

<p>“My client,” said Jarvis coolly, “did not wish to
use his own name. I suggested the seal. He used it&mdash;at
my request.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re the man, anyway,” David retorted
violently. “I insist that you release her&mdash;at once.
Do you hear? At once!”</p>

<p>“So that she can be free to marry you?” Jarvis
asked. His eyes were fixed and glittered strangely.</p>

<p>“Yes! Why not? She’s my promised wife.”</p>

<p>Jarvis stood silent for a long minute, as if considering
David’s words. Then he looked up, moving
a little toward the door with the manifest intention of
bringing the unfruitful interview to an end.</p>

<p>“I cannot say more at present than that I will endeavor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
to so arrange matters with my client as to
meet Miss Preston’s wishes,” he said.</p>

<p>He looked calmly, dispassionately at David, and
again the young man felt himself vaguely humiliated.
He had meant to say more, much more; but quite
unexpectedly he found himself bidding Jarvis good-night.
The door closed quietly upon his wrath and
discomfiture.</p>

<p>Stephen Jarvis did not at once resume the reading
of the thin blue volume which lay face down in the
bright circle of lamp-light. Instead he walked slowly
up and down the room, his brows knit, his sinewy
hands locked behind him. He was trying as conscientiously
as possible to look at the situation from
the view-point of the young man; to find, if possible,
in his own conduct some valid excuse for the (to
him) intolerable behavior of Whitcomb. While he
yet strove with himself a second visitor was announced.</p>

<p>Jarvis received this person with visible reluctance,
bade him be seated, and sat down himself, before he
opened the conversation with a tentative, “Well!”
rather impatiently uttered.</p>

<p>“I arrived this afternoon, Mr. Jarvis, and quite
fortunately fell in at once with the person in question,”
the newcomer said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jarvis dryly.</p>

<p>“As I understand my commission,” pursued Mr.
Todd, “I am to inform myself as to the person’s past,
his present occupation and habits, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>Jarvis made an impatient gesture of assent.</p>

<p>“I want to know all about him,” he said. “It is
important that I should be informed as to whether
he is fitted for a position of trust.”</p>

<p>The other man nodded.</p>

<p>“I understand,” he said.</p>

<p>“I want to know,” pursued Jarvis in a harsh
voice, “if the man is truthful, honest, temperate.
If, in short, he is the man to be implicitly trusted
with&mdash;interests of the highest value and importance.”</p>

<p>Mr. Todd again assented, his sharp ferret eyes
taking in the details of his employer’s face and person
with professional acumen.</p>

<p>“Mercantile?” he asked briskly, “or professional?
There’s a difference, you know. Now a man might be
something of a braggart, addicted to cigarette smoking,
not averse to a temperate use of intoxicants, an
occasional&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do you see all this in him already?” demanded
Jarvis.</p>

<p>Mr. Todd considered.</p>

<p>“I dined with the young man,” he said slowly,
“and acquired certain information which may or
may not have a bearing on your case.”</p>

<p>Jarvis leaned forward, glistening drops of moisture
starting out on his forehead.</p>

<p>“Is the man merely a weak fool&mdash;weak because untried
by any of the deeper experiences of life, and
foolish only because he is young? or is he&mdash;worse?”
he asked, in a low voice; “that is what I want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
know. Temperamentally the person in question is at
odds with myself. I&mdash;don’t like him. But, understand,
I must not rely on my likes and dislikes in this
matter. I&mdash;am obliged to be&mdash;fair to him, at all
costs.”</p>

<p>“I understand, Mr. Jarvis,” assented the detective.
“And I will tell you frankly that my own
initial impressions&mdash;and I have learned to rely somewhat
on first impressions as being in the main correct&mdash;are
that the person referred to is somewhat inconstant,
easily led, excitable, with all the faults of
youth and&mdash;quite possibly”&mdash;he paused to again
study the face before him, “&mdash;many of its virtues.
He is, on his own testimony, selfish, extravagant,
passionate.” He shook his head slowly. “I should
not,” he went on, “care to trust such a man with
interests calling for a high degree of business sagacity
or&mdash;er&mdash;let us say sober industry. I believe it was
something of the sort you questioned.”</p>

<p>Jarvis threw himself back in his chair. His haggard
eyes met the detective’s squarely.</p>

<p>“Is the fellow fit to marry a good and pure
woman?” he asked. “Could he command her respect
and hold her affection? That’s test enough for
me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Todd moved uneasily in his chair.</p>

<p>“Oh, as to that,” he hesitated, “there are all sorts
of women, you know. Some of ’em like a man all
the better&mdash;or appear to&mdash;if he&mdash;well; if he isn’t too
good, you know. I’ve known a woman,” he went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
strongly, “to marry a man who’d drink and abuse
her, and yet she’d love him and stick to him to the
last. There’s something queer about women, when
it comes to loving a man. His character doesn’t seem
to count for so much as you’d suppose.”</p>

<p>Jarvis assented dryly.</p>

<p>“You think the person in question would be likely
to&mdash;do as you suggested?”</p>

<p>“It would be a toss-up,” said Mr. Todd thoughtfully,
“as to whether he’d settle down into a steady,
respectable sort of a citizen, or&mdash;” he paused to button
his coat painstakingly “&mdash;the opposite. I’ll follow
him up a while longer,” he went on, “and report
from day to day. In a case like this, where you don’t
feel like trusting your own judgment, it’s best to let
facts talk.”</p>

<p>Mr. Todd looked searchingly into the depths of his
hat.</p>

<p>“Facts will talk, you know,” he said confidently.
“They’re bound to. Sooner or later, something
comes along that tells the story. I’ve shadowed many
a person in the past as could tell you that, sir, from
behind prison bars.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="pn2">XX</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">Peg Morrison</span> emulating (through the long summer
months) the shining examples reported in the agricultural
papers, found himself half-owner of a prodigious
yield of onions in the early autumn. Day
after day he had toiled amid the long lines of odorous
shoots; weeding, when weeding was a back-breaking
task under pitiless summer suns, and early and late
stirring the baked soil&mdash;for the onion specialists laid
great stress on intensive cultivation. Viewing the
great heaps of shining bulbs, red, yellow, and silver-hued,
spread out in the various barns to dry, Mr.
Morrison felt inclined to break forth into singing,
moved by something of the same exultant spirit
which has prompted successful agriculturists from the
days of the first harvests, reaped from the bosom of
the virgin earth.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Let everlastin’ thanks be thine,<br />
Fer sech a bright displa-a-y [he chanted]<br />
Es makes a world o’ darkness shine<br />
With beams o’ heavenly da-a-y!”</p>

<p class="p1">Martha Cottle, her maiden countenance coyly
shaded by a ruffled pink sun-bonnet, and bearing the
egg-basket ostentatiously in one hand, paused on the
threshold of the barn.</p>

<p>“Why, Mis-ter Morrison,” she exclaimed, “what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
a wonderful harvest of onions! I never saw anything
like it.”</p>

<p>“This ain’t all of ’em, either,” quoth Peg, pausing
long enough in his labors to wipe the beaded perspiration
from his forehead. “The only thing that gits
me is what to do with ’em, now ’t I’ve got ’em. The’
ain’t a quarter of ’em out the ground yit.”</p>

<p>“You should have thought of that before,” Miss
Cottle said wisely. “If you keep them too long
they’ll rot or freeze out here.”</p>

<p>“They sure will,” agreed Peg, with some anxiety.
“I’ve got to do somethin’ with ’em quick. I’ll bet,”
he added, “that I’ve got nigh onto three thousand
bushels&mdash;two, anyhow. The’d ’a’ b’en more, only
part of ’em didn’t come up, an’ some was spoiled b’
the dry weather. I didn’t put in more’n half I intended
to, neither. I d’clar I don’t see how that thar
John Closner of Hidalgo, Texas, made out to plant
an’ cultivate thirty-two acres of onions; an’ what in
creation he done with twenty-eight thousan’ eight
hunderd bushels when he got ’em raised beats me.
The’s an awful lot o’ onions in a hunderd bushels,
seems t’ me.”</p>

<p>Miss Cottle reflected, her eyes on Mr. Morrison’s
heated countenance.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose,” she said, “that you’d care to
take any advice from <i>me;</i> but I know what <i>I’d</i> do,
if I’d raised all those onions.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t proud,” Mr. Morrison confessed handsomely.
“I’d take advice f’om a Leghorn hen, ef<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
it p’intedly hit the nail on the head. Fire away,
ma’am. Ef you’ve got any good idees, it’s reelly
wrong t’ keep ’em to yourself, they’re kind o’ scurse
these days.”</p>

<p>He looked whimsically at the lady, whose earnest
attention appeared to be divided pretty evenly between
the shining heaps of vegetables and himself.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I shall ever smell onions again
without thinking of you, Peleg,” Miss Cottle observed
sentimentally.</p>

<p>“‘’Tis sweet to be remembered,’” quoted Peg gallantly.</p>

<p>Miss Cottle sighed deeply; then started as if suddenly
frightened by her own thoughts.</p>

<p>“What,” she demanded, dropping her basket,
which was fortunately empty, “did I say?”</p>

<p>“W’y, nothin’ in pertic’lar, ma’am,” replied Peg.
“You was speakin’ o’ disposin’ o’ th’ onions,
an’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes; but I called you by your Christian name. I
called you&mdash;<i>Peleg!</i> What <i>must</i> you think of me?”</p>

<p>“Ev’rybody mostly calls me Peleg, er Peg. I
ain’t pertic’lar es t’ that. But how ’bout them
onions? You was sayin’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I was about to inform you that my brother-in-law’s
nephew is connected with the Washington Market
in New York City,” said Miss Cottle, with a
long, quivering sigh. “I had thought of writing to
him, if you cared to have me. I should be <i>glad</i> to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
<i>something</i>&mdash;for you, Peleg. There! I’ve said it
again.”</p>

<p>“It’s mighty kind of you to write t’ your relation.
I’m bleeged t’ you, ma’am. Washin’ton Market, Noo
York City, soun’s good t’ me. But d’ye s’pose the’s
folks enough thar t’ eat all them onions?”</p>

<p>He shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>“The loft t’ the kerridge house is full of ’em, an’
the hay barn floor’s covered, an’ the’s a lot more in
the ground, es I was sayin’.”</p>

<p>Miss Cottle seated herself on an upturned bushel-basket
and gazed earnestly at the successful grower
of onions.</p>

<p>“I wish to talk to you <i>seriously</i>, Mr. Morrison, on
a subject <i>very near my heart</i>,” she said. “Will you
not sit down on this box”&mdash;indicating a place at her
side&mdash;“and listen?”</p>

<p>“I’d ought t’ be gittin’ them onions out th’
groun’,” protested Peg, with a wary glint in his eye.
But he sat down gingerly on the edge of the box.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking <i>deeply</i> on the situation here
on the farm,” pursued Miss Cottle. “I do not feel
that I am doing <i>right</i> to remain here longer, <i>under
the circumstances</i>.”</p>

<p>Peg fumbled the rampant locks behind his left ear,
in a fashion he had when perplexed.</p>

<p>“Under the circumstances,” he repeated dubiously.
“The circumstances is all right; ain’t they?”</p>

<p>“I appear to have dropped into the position of
hired girl to Barbara Preston,” pursued the spinster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
acidly. “She did her own work previous to my coming;
now I do most of it. But that isn’t all; I was
engaged as housekeeper and caretaker for that boy.
She was to go away and <i>stay</i> for five years.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe she’ll go soon now,” hazarded Peg. He
shook his head slowly. “Kind o’ funny ’bout that
business,” he murmured. “I dunno who in creation
bid her in.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t mind that so much,” pursued Miss
Cottle, “but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She paused dramatically to allow the full force of
her remark to fall on the unsuspecting man.</p>

<p>“There’s been considerable talk in the village
lately&mdash;<i>about you and me</i>. It’s come to me straight.”</p>

<p>“No!” exclaimed Peg, hastily gaining his legs and
feeling for his pipe in his rear breeches pocket with
agitated haste.</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe it, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Can you deny,” intoned Miss Cottle strongly,
“that the subject of your attentions to me was
brought up and discussed in Hewett’s grocery store
less than a week ago?”</p>

<p>“I said it wa’n’t so, ma’am; I told ’em the’ wa’n’t
nothin’ in it.”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> told them, Peleg Morrison? <i>You</i> denied
that you intended to marry me? How could you?”</p>

<p>“W’y, ma’am, you know&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You should, at least, have afforded <i>me</i> the opportunity
of denying the report&mdash;if it was to be denied.”</p>

<p>Miss Cottle buried her face in her hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>“I supposed,” she went on, in a smothered voice,
“that you had more regard for the sacred feelings
of a good woman. I thought, Peleg, you&mdash;cared&mdash;a
little&mdash;for me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my! Gosh&mdash;goll&mdash;durn&mdash;what&mdash;in&mdash;thunder&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Miss Cottle’s strong, determined hand shot out and
fastened tentacle-like upon the unfortunate Peleg’s
sleeve.</p>

<p>“I shall leave this very day&mdash;<i>never</i> to return,” she
said, in a hollow voice, “unless you and I come to an
understanding. I cannot endure it longer.”</p>

<p>“O Lord!” exclaimed Peg prayerfully.</p>

<p>“I <i>love</i> that <i>dear</i> little boy as if he was my <i>own</i>,”
pursued Miss Cottle sentimentally, “and I <i>feel</i> that
my <i>duty</i> calls me to remain and care for him;
but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I reelly hope you won’t go on my ’count, ma’am,”
faltered Peg, moved by these protestations and once
more mindful of Barbara’s exhortations.</p>

<p>“<i>Peleg!</i>” exclaimed Miss Cottle beatifically, and
instantly relaxed upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Say, ma’am! You know&mdash;reelly, I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am <i>so</i> happy, Peleg!” gurgled the spinster.</p>

<p>“Wall, I ain’t; I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I knew you would understand my feelings.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t, ma’am. Kindly set down, an’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I shall remain <i>now</i> and do my duty with a <i>light
heart</i>. I feel that the arrangement will be <i>much better</i>
for <i>all</i> concerned, and I can make you <i>so</i> comfortable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Peleg. You need half a dozen new shirts,
and shall I confess it? I have them nearly completed
already.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morrison, looking wildly about for a means
of escape, caught sight of Jimmy running past the
door, a brace of puppies frolicking at his heels.</p>

<p>“Hello, thar, Cap’n!” he called, “don’t you want
t’ step in here an’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The <i>dear</i> child,” murmured Miss Cottle, wiping
her eyes on her apron. “He shall be the first to
share our happiness. I am going to be married to
your kind old friend here, James; aren’t you <i>glad</i>,
my boy?”</p>

<p>Jimmy gazed doubtfully at the pair from under
puckered brows.</p>

<p>“Married?” he echoed. “What for?”</p>

<p>“Say, Cap’n, you’ve struck the nail on the head,
es usual!” cried Peg, regaining his composure with
an effort. “I guess the lady don’t altogether know
her own mind. She was kind o’ calc’latin’ on bein’
married t’ me. But she’s thought better of it b’ now,
an’ I’m bearin’ up es well es I kin under the circumstances.
The’ ain’t goin’t’ be no weddin’. No, sir!
She’s changed her mind sence she come in here.
D’ye hear, ma’am? You couldn’t put up with ol’
Peg Morrison. Y’ tried to, f’om a strict sense o’
duty; but y’ reelly couldn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“<i>Peleg!</i>” exclaimed Miss Cottle sharply. “You
must have taken leave of your senses!”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am, I ain’t. The Cap’n here’ll bear witness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
that I said you’d give me up. That’ll put a
stop t’ the talk&mdash;ef the’ is any. You c’n tell ’em that.
I won’t deny it. I c’n stan’ it.”</p>

<p>A light as of tardy victory dawned in Miss Cottle’s
eyes.</p>

<p>“You won’t deny that we’ve been engaged to be
married?” she said slowly.</p>

<p>“No, ma’am; you c’n say anythin’ you’ve a mind
to. It’s all the same t’ me, now ’t you’ve give me up.
I feel turrible bad&mdash;all broke up; but I’m a-goin’ t’
stan’ it the best I kin. Religion ’ll help some, I
guess. It gene’lly does. I’ll try it, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“I might reconsider,” observed Miss Cottle, “before”&mdash;she
added darkly&mdash;“the affair becomes public.
I fear the notoriety will be very hard for you to
bear, Peleg.”</p>

<p>“It will, ma’am,” replied Peg with alacrity; “but
I’m goin’ t’ try an’ endure it.”</p>

<p>Miss Cottle meditatively stirred the onions with
one foot clad substantially in rusty leather.</p>

<p>“I shall hold you to the engagement which you
have acknowledged,” she said firmly, “unless&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What? Fer goodness sake don’t keep me on
tenter-hooks, ma’am! W’y, say, you don’t want me!
I ain’t fit t’ wipe m’ feet on your door-mat; you’ve
said so lots o’ times; ain’t she, Cap’n? I’m an ornary
cuss; more ornary ’n you hev any idee of; an’ I’m
humbly’s a hedge-fence, ’n’&mdash;’n’ bad-tempered; m’
disposition’s somethin’ fierce. The Cap’n here c’n
tell you that. W’y, land, I dunno but what I’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
be drove to drink, ef I was t’ git married! I’ll bet I
would. An’ what with my t’bacco&mdash;y’ know y’ hate
that like pison, an’ m’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If my brother-in-law’s nephew should make you
an offer for these onions, I feel that I ought to have a
share in the proceeds,” said Miss Cottle, suddenly
abandoning sentiment for business. “If we were to
carry out our engagement of marriage, of course I
should reasonably expect to profit by the arrangement.”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am; you wouldn’t, not whilst I was alive.
I’m downright stingy. That’s another thing I fergot
t’ mention. Stingy? W’y, I’m closter ’n the
bark t’ a tree. ’Nough sight closter, ’cause the
bark’ll give when the tree grows. But not Peleg Morrison;
no, ma’am! I’ll bet you wouldn’t git ’nough
t’ eat, with me fer a pervider. An’ I’ve made up my
mind long ago to leave ev’rythin’ I’ve got t’ the
Cap’n here. M’ will’s all made. But I’ll tell you
what I’ll do. I’ll give you&mdash;a hunderd dollars cash,
ef I sell the onions, ’n ef you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Make it two hundred, and I’ll agree to let you off.
You couldn’t do me out of my widow’s third, anyway
you’d fix it.”</p>

<p>Peg stared at the determined spinster in silence
for a long minute. Then with a muttered exclamation,
he dashed out of the barn and disappeared.</p>

<p>Miss Cottle’s eyes sparkled with animosity.</p>

<p>“If I was to sue him for breach of promise, and I
could do it, too, I guess he&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>She paused in her meditations to stare wrathfully
at the spectacle of the recalcitrant Peleg returning
at full speed, a small, yellow-leaved book in his hand.</p>

<p>“Here we be, ma’am!” he exclaimed. “Now we’ll
see whar we’re at. I gene’lly find somethin’ t’ fit
the ’casion, an’ I’ll bet I kin this time.”</p>

<p>He rapidly turned the pages with a moistened
thumb and fingers.</p>

<p>“‘Receipt fer horse linament.’ No; that won’t
do. ‘Foot an’ mouth disease,’ ‘How t’ git fat; an’
how not t’ git fat,’ ‘Blind staggers, ‘n’ how t’
pervent,’ ‘Jell-cake&mdash;&mdash; ’”</p>

<p>“What,” demanded Miss Cottle sharply, “is that
book? And what possible connection does it have
with our affairs?”</p>

<p>Mr. Morrison paused, his thumb in his mouth.</p>

<p>“W’y, this,” he explained, “is my book of vallable
inf’mation. It’s got ev’rythin’ to do with ’em, ma’am.
I ain’t never be’n exactly in this ’ere fix b’fore; but
I’ll bet the’s inf’mation in this ’ere book ’at’ll fit the
case all right. You jus’ set down, ma’am, an’ make
yourself comf’table, while&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“This is outrageous!” snapped Miss Cottle.</p>

<p>“Maybe I’d better run and get my book, too,”
volunteered Jimmy, who had been an interested but
sadly puzzled spectator of the scene. “P’raps
there’ll be somethin’ vallable in mine.”</p>

<p>“All right, Cap’n; run ’long,” said Peg briskly.
“Now, listen t’ this, ma’am. ‘The sleepin’ fox
ketches no poultry.’ That’s good; but the trouble is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
you ’pear to be wide-awake. Hold on; don’t git
’xcited. Here’s a little inf’mation on the subjec’ o’
fools. I copied it out the almanac nigh onto twenty
years ago, an’ it can’t be beat. ‘’Xperience keeps a
dear school, but fools will learn in no other.’ An’
this, ’t I got out o’ a story book, ‘The’ ain’t nothin’
so becomin’ t’ a fool es a shet mouth.’ An’ mebbe
this here has some bearin’s on the case: ‘Don’t meddle
with these three things: a buzz-saw, a kickin’ mule,
an’ a woman’s ’at’s mad clear through.’ They’re all
alike in one pertic’lar&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I shall certainly sue for breach of promise!” announced
Miss Cottle, treading recklessly among the
onions on her way to the door.</p>

<p>“No, ma’am; you won’t,” quoth Peg placidly.
“‘Whar the’s be’n no promise thar c’n be no breach.’
I wrote that down ’bout the year fifty-nine. I wa’n’t
’s old’s I be now; but I’ve kep’ it in mind pretty constant.
You fix it so ’t I’ll sell them onions at a fair
profit ’n’ I’ll give ye a hunderd dollars. ’N’ you c’n
tell your lady friends that ol’ Peg Morrison’s sech a
scalawag ’at you couldn’t hear t’ marryin’ him,
not ef he was the las’ man on earth. An’ that’s the
truth. You couldn’t hear t’ it, an’ you c’n bet I
wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“I shall leave this house to-day.&mdash;<i>To-day</i>, Peleg
Morrison; do you <i>hear</i>?”</p>

<p>Peg glanced up from his anxious scrutiny of the
pages of accumulated lore with a look of deep thankfulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sho! you don’t say so?” he exclaimed. “Wall,
take this ’long with you t’ med’tate over: ‘A blue-bottle
fly makes a turrible sight of loud buzzin’, but
take notice ’at it don’t git anywhar.’ An’ this: ‘Run
your head into a stone wall, ef you feel like doin’ it;
but don’t blame the wall none fer what happens.”</p>

<p>Jimmy running blithely toward the barn with his
book of Vallable Inf’mation in one hand and his
cherished bottle of red ink in the other, met the irate
Miss Cottle on the way.</p>

<p>“I’m a-going to do <i>once</i> what I’ve been simply
<i>achin’</i> to do ever since I set foot onto this place!”
she cried shrilly; and seizing the child by the shoulder
she gave him a violent shaking, concluding with a
hard-handed slap or two over the ear.</p>

<p>“Take <i>that</i>, you little tyke, you! If I’d ’a’ had
you in hand for five years steady, with her gone, I’d
’a’ taken some of the laugh and smartness out of you!
But now I wash my hands of you and her and him!”</p>

<p>The child, too astonished to cry out, writhed out of
the spinster’s bony grip.</p>

<p>“I ’spise you,” he sputtered, “you ol’&mdash;ol’&mdash;Cottle
woman! ’n’&mdash;’n’&mdash;I’ll put it in my Vallable
Inf’mation book ’at you&mdash;slapped me when I was
good!”</p>

<p>Miss Cottle made another dive at him, and was met
by a copious shower of red ink from the loosely
corked bottle, which Jimmy discharged at his assailant
with the practised aim of the small boy. Then
he took to his heels, to be received into asylum by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Peg Morrison, who was watching the proceedings
from the barn-door.</p>

<p>“Wall, Cap’n,” he said, “you sure did put that
red ink to good use. Don’t you cry, son; I’ll git ye
another bottle twict es big b’fore sun-down.”</p>

<p>He chuckled deep within his capacious chest as he
smoothed the little boy’s ruffled curls with his big,
horny hand.</p>

<p>“You an’ me’ll hev to write out a little vallable
inf’mation on the subjec’ o’ females,” he said slowly.
“The’s all kinds an’ varieties of wimmin-folks; ’n’
t’ git ’em all sorted an’ labelled, so ’t ye won’t git
teetotally fooled ’ll take the better part of a lifetime.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">XXI</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">Barbara</span> was shut into her chamber looking over her
wardrobe with a view to approaching winter. In the
autumn the call would come, Jarvis had told her.
Already the ripening apples glowed like live coals
along the laden orchard boughs, and the brisk September
winds scattered drifts of yellowing leaves
about the feet of the early dying locusts below her
windows. Martha Cottle was gone, after a stormy
scene in which she had exacted redress and largesse
of the most lavish description. Barbara had drawn
a long breath of relief when the last echo of the spinster’s
strident voice and the last militant thump of
her flat-heeled shoes had died away.</p>

<p>Peg and Jimmy had openly exulted in the final retreat
of the enemy; and Peg took occasion to exhort
his dearly beloved mistress anew concerning the inscrutable
yet invariably benevolent workings of
Providence, as signally evidenced in the hasty departure
of Martha Cottle.</p>

<p>“Ef it hadn’t be’n fer them onions,” he declared,
“she’d never have took a fancy t’ me. ’N’ ef I hadn’t
’a’ heard o’ John Closner of Hidalgo, Texas, ’s like’s
not I’d ’a’ never took t’ raisin’ ’em. Them onions
kinder drored Marthy’s ’tention t’ me&mdash;she thinkin’
’at mebbe I’d git a heap o’ money fer ’em, ’n’ then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
be accommodatin’ ’nough t’ die an’ go t’ heaven immediate.
Yes, ma’am, she’d got it all worked out in
her own mind, even t’ widow’s thirds. Then, y’ see,
the Cap’n’s red ink fitted right in t’ the scheme o’
salvation; an’ here we be. I figger it this way: the
Lord hes be’n ’quainted with Marthy Cottle fer a
spell longer’n we hev, an’ <i>He</i> knew she wa’n’t fit t’
b’ left in charge o’ the Cap’n, t’ say nothin’ o’ things
in general.”</p>

<p>“But what shall I do with Jimmy?” murmured
Barbara, wrinkling her forehead perplexedly. “It
won’t be long now before I shall be obliged to leave
him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry none ’bout that,” advised Peg.
“Everythin’s a-comin’ out all right. I’ll bet a dollar’n
a half,” he went on, raising his voice to a high
argumentative pitch, “that the Lord hes got his
plans all made a’ready. W’y, Miss Barb’ry, it’ll do
you a heap o’ good t’ jus’ take notice o’ the way the
Lord kind o’ fetches things ’round in this ’ere world.
I’ve got so ’t I don’t put in a minute worryin’.
Daytimes I’m too blamed busy, an’ nights I’m too
sleepy ’n’ tired; ’n’ I’ve learned f’om a long life of
experience ’at worryin’ ain’t no kind o’ use, anyhow.
Things is bein’ worked ’round fer you, nigh an’ fur,
an’ the fust thing you know you’re gittin’ ’long all
hunky-dory. Mebbe doin’ the very thing you wanted
to do all the while, but thought you couldn’t, nohow
you’d fix it.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could believe it,” sighed Barbara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>“All you’ve got t’ do is t’ begin t’ take notice,”
urged Peg. “You don’t have t’ make no speshul
effort. Keep yer eyes peeled an’ watch out. I
ain’t worryin’ none ’bout the Cap’n. You bet I
ain’t.”</p>

<p>Barbara was thinking about Peg’s homely and
comfortable philosophy as she laid the last neatly
folded garment into the till of her trunk; and mingled
with her dubious musings on the scope and nature of
that mysteriously active power, known in current
phrase as “Providence,” and as commonly reckoned
hostile, in the world’s judgment, were thoughts of
David. Not altogether happy were these uppermost
reflections in Barbara’s mind, as evidenced by her
brooding eyes and the downward droop of her red
mouth. She loved David (she assured herself) yet
she could not but be conscious of inward reserves,
tremors, even resentments. She constantly caught
herself explaining, excusing, defending him before the
bar of that clear-eyed self which had never yet
yielded to his hot kisses and close embraces. She
loved him (she was sure) but she also pitied him, for
his evident weaknesses, his frequent deflections from
her own high ideals of manhood, for his multiplied offenses
against her maiden modesty. Almost insensibly
she had been forced into an attitude of watchfulness,
guarding herself against his too ardent and
careless approaches, soothing the gloom and irritation
which alternated with not infrequent periods of
coldness and neglect, when he chanced to be feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
sorry for himself, in view of what he was pleased to
regard as the sacrifice of his future.</p>

<p>David had not acquainted Barbara with the result
of his latest interview with Jarvis. He hated
Jarvis, and he took small pains to conceal the fact;
but he jealously hid his unshaken conviction with
regard to the money, which he had made up his mind
Jarvis had given to Barbara. After a little he even
concluded that it need not be repaid.</p>

<p>“Miserly old crab,” he told himself. “It won’t
hurt him to let Barbara have that much out of his
pile.”</p>

<p>Something of this thought colored his words when
he discussed the question with Barbara.</p>

<p>“You’ll marry me in November, won’t you?” he
pleaded, “if the fellow doesn’t show up before then?
We can pay him all right&mdash;if we have to.”</p>

<p>“If we have to?” echoed Barbara, with a straight
look at him. “Why do you say that?”</p>

<p>“It’s a good bit of money&mdash;four thousand dollars.
Perhaps some&mdash;er&mdash;philanthropical jay gave
it to you outright, Barbie. I shouldn’t be so very
much surprised.”</p>

<p>He laughed at the proud curl of her lips.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t care, would you?” he persisted,
“if some old duffer had taken it into his noddle to
do a good deed? Once we are married, I shan’t
bother to unearth him, you’d better believe. I’m in
favor of letting sleeping philanthropists lie&mdash;eh,
Barbie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll not be married,” Barbara said, in a low
voice, “till&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He caught her suddenly about the waist and
stopped her words with one of his close kisses.</p>

<p>“You shan’t say it,” he murmured, his lips still on
hers.</p>

<p>She twisted sharply out of his grasp, her face
crimsoning slowly.</p>

<p>“I wish&mdash;you wouldn’t, David.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t what, little wife?” he drawled, reaching
for her lazily from his comfortable seat in the
corner of the sofa.</p>

<p>“I am not your wife,” she said coldly.</p>

<p>“Pretty near,” he laughed; “too near for such
little exhibitions of prudery.”</p>

<p>His eyes, vividly blue and sparkling under their
long curling lashes, met hers with a look which she
silently resented.</p>

<p>“I have sold the apples on the trees,” she said
presently, seating herself near the window, under
pretence of getting a better light on her sewing.</p>

<p>David yawned audibly, and thrust his hands into
his trousers pockets.</p>

<p>“You have&mdash;eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and for a good price, as prices go, Peg
says.”</p>

<p>“How much?” he wanted to know.</p>

<p>She told him, and he shook his head.</p>

<p>“Do y’ know, that old Morrison is a fool. I
mean to get rid of him, when I take charge here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>Barbara was silent.</p>

<p>“The old chap doesn’t know enough to last him
over night,” pursued David. “I don’t believe you’d
ever have gotten into such a hole financially, if it
hadn’t been for his running things into the ground.
What you want is a couple of capable young men
about the place. Of course we’ll keep some decent
horses. I’ve bought one already, a beauty! Come
out and look at him, Barbie. Or, say, put on your
hat and I’ll take you for a spin. We’ll take in the
county fair, if you say so. It’s in full blast to-day.”</p>

<p>She arose and folded her work.</p>

<p>“Not to-day, David; I’ve bread to bake. But I’ll
come out and look at your horse.”</p>

<p>“You’re getting so confoundedly difficult, Barbara.
I never know how to take you,” complained
David, as they walked, a little apart, along the
gravel path.</p>

<p>He turned to look at her and was struck afresh by
her beauty. During the long days of the summer that
was past, she seemed to have bloomed into a new and
more vivid loveliness. He drew his breath sharply
as his eyes lingered on the rich red of her mouth,
the full column of her round white throat, and the
soft undulations of her figure as she moved slowly
under the dazzling light of the September sky.</p>

<p>“If you weren’t such a tearing beauty,” he said,
under his breath, “I don’t know as I could stand for
it long. You’re forever treading on a fellow’s toes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
did you know it, Barbie? Now, I like a woman to be
sweet and&mdash;er&mdash;yielding.”</p>

<p>He smiled at the vision of Jennie, the pink-cheeked
waitress at the Barford Eagle, which chose to obtrude
itself at the moment. The humble, almost suppliant
look of adoration in her childish blue eyes had lately,
afforded David a vast amount of indolent amusement.</p>

<p>“A woman,” he went on, didactically, “ought not
to be always thinking of herself.”</p>

<p>“I know that, David,” Barbara said meekly. “I
try not to. But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s just it!” he broke in quickly; “there’s
always a ‘but’ in your mind and in your attitude
towards me, and always has been. You needn’t deny
it,” he added, openly complacent, in view of his own
cleverness. “I know women.”</p>

<p>The girl looked at him in silence, a mutinous question
behind her closed lips.</p>

<p>David smiled down at her brilliantly, his eyes, his
tawny hair, his white teeth, and his ruddy color
suggesting the magnificent youth and virility of a
pagan deity, newly alighted on the common earth.</p>

<p>“The fact is, Barbara,” he went on confidently,
“you’ve lived here so long practically alone that
you’re a bit spoiled. What you need is to give up
trying to control everything and everybody and just
be a sweet little wife. Didn’t you know that?”</p>

<p>Her eyes drooped under the blue fire of his gaze.
David laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“I’ll make you happy,” he said, possessing himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
of her hand. “You won’t know yourself a year
from now, little girl. All this worry will be over;
and I’m never going to allow you to bother your
dear little head again over farm-products and such
things as cows, pigs, and chickens. I mean to give
up a lot of that sort of farming. It doesn’t pay, and
it’s a whole lot of useless bother and expense. There!
what do you think of my horse? Isn’t he a beauty?
Look at his head and eyes, will you? and the build and
color of him? There’s blood for you, and I tell you
he’s a hummer on the road!”</p>

<p>Barbara passed a knowing little hand over the
satin neck, and the horse turned his large, full, intelligent
eyes upon her with a whinny of welcome.</p>

<p>“He likes you, Barbie; first thing. Perhaps you
can drive him after a while. But just now he’s like
a certain little woman I know, a bit restive and
needing a strong hand to guide and control. You
don’t mind my seeing it so clearly, do you,
dear?”</p>

<p>Barbara threw back her head and looked at him
from under lowered lashes.</p>

<p>“I mind your saying it,” she said. “And I may
as well tell you&mdash;now&mdash;that I don’t intend to discharge
Peg; and I must always have a voice in the
management of the farm. It is Jimmy’s farm, you
know.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard you say so before,” he said sulkily.
“But why isn’t half of it yours, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“Because Jimmy is the last Preston, and father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
wanted it so. I shall have all that comes off of it
till Jimmy is of age. We&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She hesitated, with a doubtful look at him.
“There is other good land near. We shall, perhaps,
be able to acquire it; start fresh orchards, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Perhaps&mdash;perhaps!” he echoed irritably. “I’ll
tell you straight it’s all nonsense. Under the law
you’re entitled to half. Ask old Jarvis, if you don’t
believe me.”</p>

<p>He watched the quick color rise in Barbara’s face,
with a low laugh of arrogant amusement.</p>

<p>“Jarvis is a curious old duffer,” he added, lazily
stroking the smooth shoulder of his horse. “But he
knows rather better than to tackle me on certain subjects.”</p>

<p>His eyes were fastened on Barbara, narrowly
watching her.</p>

<p>“He’s tried it once or twice; but I called his bluff
each time. He hasn’t been here lately, has he?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Barbara faintly.</p>

<p>“Well, he’d best keep his distance; that’s all.”</p>

<p>He turned quickly at sound of a boyish whoop
from behind.</p>

<p>“Oh, hello, Jimmy!” he said carelessly. “How’s
your majesty’s highness to-day?”</p>

<p>“I’m pretty well, ’xcept that bof my front teef are
loose,” replied the little boy seriously. “I can’t eat
corn or apples, ’cept wiv my side teef.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it’s about time you taught that
boy to speak the English language, Barbara?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
It’s <i>teeth</i> and <i>with</i>, my boy. Don’t let me hear you
make that babyish blunder again.”</p>

<p>The child hung his head, his face flushing to a
shamed scarlet under his thatch of yellow hair.</p>

<p>“I’m going to try,” he said manfully.</p>

<p>“Want to take a ride with me, old man?” asked
David. “Your sister says she can’t.”</p>

<p>Jimmy looked up eagerly into Barbara’s face for
the coveted permission.</p>

<p>“I’m going to drive over to the fair,” pursued
David. “I’d like to take my best girl along pretty
well; but you’ll do, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>Barbara hesitated, her eyes averted.</p>

<p>“Of course, if you’re afraid to trust him with
me&mdash;&mdash;” mocked David. “I’ve a tolerably fast horse
here, and I’m supposed to be a reckless&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that,” she interrupted hurriedly. “He
may go, if he’d like to.”</p>

<p>Jimmy burst into a shout of joy.</p>

<p>“I guess I’d better brush my hair,” he exulted,
“and put on my best clo’es! Shall I, Barbara?”</p>

<p>“You’re well enough as you are,” David said
peremptorily. “Jump in, boy, and we’ll be off!”</p>

<p>She stood watching them as they drove away, the
little boy’s yellow hair blowing about his rosy face.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Barbara!” he shouted. “We’re going
awful fast!”</p>

<p>David’s attention seemed centred upon his horse.
He did not once look at the girl, as she waved her
hand in token of a cheerful good-bye.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XXII</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">David</span> was quite his expansive, good-humored self
again by the time he and Jimmy reached the fair-grounds.
He joked with the little boy about his
capacity for pink lemonade and peanuts as he drove
his spirited young horse carefully into the crowded
enclosure; and Jimmy, all eager and glowing with
joyous anticipation, gazed with round eyes at the
stirring scene. Everywhere flags fluttered merrily
in the wind, and the crash and blare of band-music
mingled with the shouts of vendors, the trampling of
feet, and the hum of many voices.</p>

<p>“Hello, Dave! Goin’ t’ trot that nag o’ yourn?”
called a voice from among the crowd of men and boys
lined up along the race-track.</p>

<p>“Oh, hello, Bud Hawley! That you?” responded
Dave, pulling in his horse. “Why, no; I hadn’t
thought of it. It’s too late to enter; isn’t it?”</p>

<p>The Barford liveryman, tipping a solemn wink at
the men near him, slowly advanced and stood, his
hat pulled low over his eyes, examining David’s horse.
He passed an experienced hand over his withers,
felt his hock-joints, lifted his feet, and stared critically
at the frogs and the setting of his shoes. Then
he sauntered around in front and looked the animal
full in the face, his cautious hand still feeling, caressing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
sliding from neck to powerful shoulder, from
shoulder to slender foreleg.</p>

<p>“Say, Dave,” he drawled at length, “that ain’t a
half bad horse. ’F I was you, I’d enter him. Like
’s not you’d pull off some money; mebbe enough t’
buy a new buggy. The’s a free-fer-all comin’ off
’bout four-thirty. I’ll see t’ enterin’ him fer you, if
you say so. ’N’ I dunno but what I’d back him t’
the extent of a few dollars. What d’ you say t’ lettin’
me drive him, ’n’ go shares on possible winnin’s?”</p>

<p>David laughed arrogantly.</p>

<p>“I’d say ’no’ to that last,” he said. “I’ll drive
him myself, if I enter him at all. Where’s the
office?”</p>

<p>Mr. Hawley thrust his hands deep into his trousers
pockets, where he thoughtfully jingled some
loose silver.</p>

<p>“Better let me handle the ribbons,” he advised.
“I c’n git the paces out o’ him without ha’f killin’
him, ’n’ that’s more’n some folks c’n do. I ain’t
anxious, though, ’s fur’s that’s concerned. But you’d
have the fun o’ lookin’ on from the grand stand.”</p>

<p>“There’s something in that,” admitted David.</p>

<p>“If y’ never drove in a race,” pursued Mr. Hawley,
“y’ don’t want t’ begin t’-day. There’ll sure
be a ruck o’ horses in that free-fer-all.”</p>

<p>David glanced over the rail at the spectacle of half
a dozen horses hitched to light sulkies and driven
at a furious rate of speed, which at that moment
dashed past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>“Them’s the two-year-olds,” vouchsafed Mr.
Hawley. “I ain’t speshully int’rested in seein’ ’em
go it. Don’t b’lieve in racin’ colts m’self. It’s too
much like givin’ a man’s work t’ a boy. Breaks ’em
down, like es not, b’fore they’ve had a fair chance.”</p>

<p>He glanced kindly at Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Well, son,” he went on, “how d’ you like the
fair?”</p>

<p>“I like it,” Jimmy said shyly. “I like the music
an’ the horses an’ the flags ’n’&mdash;’n’ everythin’.”</p>

<p>“Want to get out, old man, and take in the side-shows?”
asked David.</p>

<p>“What are side-shows?” Jimmy demanded guilelessly.</p>

<p>Mr. Hawley laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“A little bit of everythin’,” he answered. “The’s
the agercult’ral exhibit&mdash;I seen some o’ your apples
an’ a pile o’ them onions Peg Morrison’s be’n
raisin’ in there. An’ there’s the woman’s tent, with
the bigges’ lot o’ patchwork an’ jell’-cake an’ canned
fruit y’ ever saw. I jus’ come f’om there. Y’ c’n
hitch over yonder, if y’ wan’ to, Dave.”</p>

<p>David’s eyes had been roaming somewhat impatiently
over the gay scene. He thrust his hand into
his pocket.</p>

<p>“See here, boy,” he said to Jimmy, “you take
this small change and go around to suit yourself. I
don’t care anything about all that sort of thing.
But you can take it in as long as you’ve a mind to.”</p>

<p>“What! All b’ my lone?” asked Jimmy, a frightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
look in his brown eyes. “I guess I’d rather
stay wiv you, David.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said David sternly. “You’re not a
baby, are you? Can’t you walk around and look at
pigs and chickens and patchwork quilts without a
guardian? You’ve got to quit being such a molly-coddle,
my boy, and we’ll begin right now. Come!
jump out, and I’ll look you up after a while. You
couldn’t get lost, if you tried. Run along now and
have a good time.”</p>

<p>“Her brother, ain’t it?” inquired Mr. Hawley, as
David lifted the child to the ground.</p>

<p>“Get in, won’t you?” David said, ignoring the
question. “We’ll look into that race proposition.
I don’t know but what I’ll go in for it. I wouldn’t
mind making a little money on the side.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hawley accepted the invitation with a backward
glance at Jimmy, who stood watching them
forlornly, his rosy mouth half open, the silver pieces
tightly clutched in one moist little hand.</p>

<p>“Kind o’ small, ain’t he, to be goin’ ’round by himself
in a place like this?” he ventured. “I’ll bet his
sister wouldn’t like it over an’ ’bove.”</p>

<p>“He’s been pretty well spoiled,” David said
sharply. “I intend to make a man of him, and this
is as good a way to begin as any. There’s nothing
to hurt him around here.”</p>

<p>“You may ’xperience some trouble in locatin’ him
after a spell,” opined Mr. Hawley, shaking his head.
“I remember m’ wife let me bring one o’ our boys t’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the fair once, a number o’ years ago, when Lansing,
our oldest boy, was ’bout five. I was lookin’ at the
live-stock, an’ Lance, he got kind o’ tuckered out, an’
I sez to him&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut out the details,” David interrupted.
“You didn’t lose the kid for good, did you?”</p>

<p>“No; I got him after a while; but it pretty near
scared the life out o’ me an’ him both, I remember; ’n’
m’ wife&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Come,” said David, with some impatience, “and
we’ll enter the horse.”</p>

<p>He turned and stared sharply at the other man.</p>

<p>“You ought to know what you’re talking about,
Hawley, when you say my horse stands a good show
to win. Suppose I change my mind and allow you
to drive him, and you let him be beaten. What
then?”</p>

<p>The liveryman shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“You ain’t no sport, Dave; it’s easy t’ see that,”
he drawled. “If I drive your horse, I’ll do my
best, o’ course. I dunno what sort o’ horses ’ll be
entered in that free-fer-all. But judgin’ from past
seasons and what I seen outside in the way o’ horseflesh,
I sh’d say&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He paused and winked solemnly at David.</p>

<p>“Try me an’ see,” he advised. “‘F I lose, I won’t
sen’ you no bill fer las’ month’s liv’ry. An’ it ’u’d
naturally be a stiff one.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said David. “Done! and we’ll have a
drink on it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lemonade fer mine, ’f I’m a-goin’ t’ drive,” said
Mr. Hawley.</p>

<p>But David drank something stronger. He felt the
need of it, he said.</p>

<p>Later, having settled the preliminaries of the race,
David sauntered forth with a hazy notion of looking
up Jimmy and taking him up to the grand stand. To
this end he walked slowly through the agricultural
“pavilion,” with its exhibits of mammoth vegetables
and pyramids of red, green, and russet fruit; but
nowhere did he catch a glimpse of Jimmy’s yellow
head topped with its scarlet tam. There was a
crowd of women in the next place of exhibition, where
the pine and canvas walls were covered with quilts
of wonderful and complicated design, varied with
areas of painted tapestries, home-made lace, worsted
and crochet work; while the narrow shelves below
were occupied with brown loaves, raised biscuit, and
frosted cakes, interspersed with jellies of brilliant
hues and luscious fruits preserved in lucent syrups.
There were many children here, clinging to maternal
hands and skirts; but no Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Little nuisance,” muttered David irritably.
“He ought to have stayed where I told him to.”</p>

<p>He was elbowing his way through a group of
women engaged in an excited discussion concerning
the merits of two rival lace counterpanes, when a
small figure placed itself directly in his path.</p>

<p>He stopped short and looked down into the babyish
blue eyes uplifted timidly to his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, hello, Jennie!” he said, smiling. “Where
did you come from?”</p>

<p>The girl was very becomingly dressed in dark-blue
serge, the jacket thrown jauntily wide, revealing a
waist of cheap white lace, which in its turn permitted
glimpses of the pink skin and rounded contours
beneath. A hat of dark-blue straw, wreathed with
small pink roses, rested coquettishly on her light-brown
curly hair. At the moment of meeting David
thus unexpectedly, the light of youth and love shone
vividly over the girl’s insignificant face and figure,
irradiating them into a beauty almost noble.</p>

<p>David could hardly help noticing the half infantile,
wholly adorable curve of her young brows and the
clear blue light of the eyes beneath. Then his curious
eyes slowly swept the soft oval of pink cheek and the
rosy mouth, parted a little to ease the tumultuous
heart-beats which shook the transparent stuff at her
throat.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know as you’d want to speak to me, Mr.
Whitcomb,” murmured the girl.</p>

<p>Her eyes wandered uncertainly past him into the
crowd.</p>

<p>“I s’pose,” she added, thrusting out her pink lips
in a pout, “that <i>she’s</i> here somewheres.”</p>

<p>“No,” laughed David. “‘She’ doesn’t happen to
be along to-day.”</p>

<p>A wayward impulse prompted his next words.</p>

<p>“What do you think, Jennie? I asked her and she
wouldn’t come with me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wouldn’t come&mdash;with you?”</p>

<p>The girl’s voice held wonder, incredulity, longing.
Her eyes said more.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t treat me that way, would you,
Jennie?”</p>

<p>The girl looked down, an unsuspected delicacy
sealing her lips.</p>

<p>David looked at the pretty shadowy circle of the
long lashes on the smooth pink cheek.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t; now, would you, Jennie?” he persisted.</p>

<p>The girl glanced at him sidewise, and tossed her
head.</p>

<p>“What do you want t’ know for?” she demanded.
“If you don’t like the way she treats you, you c’n
tell her so, can’t you?”</p>

<p>David bit his lip.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want some ice cream, Jennie?” he
asked.</p>

<p>The girl hesitated.</p>

<p>“I came t’ the fair with Gus Bamber,” she said.
“An’ what do you think, we hadn’t no more’n got
here when Sutton got after Gus t’ help him in the
refreshment booth. Said the other fellow he’d hired
wasn’t no good at mixin’ drinks; an’ so nothin’ would
do but he must have Gus t’ help. Both of us was
awful mad; but we didn’t das’ say so to old Sutton.
He’s somethin’ fierce if you don’t do ’xactly as he
says.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Gus?” asked David.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, that’s pretty good!” giggled the girl. “I
guess you’d ought t’ know Gus Bamber b’ this time.
He waits on you often enough at the Eagle.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean Sutton’s barkeep&mdash;Gus; yes,
that’s so. I didn’t know his name was Bamber,
though.”</p>

<p>“It is,” the girl said. “Augustus Bamber. I
think it’s a real nice name, too. But I don’t like it
’s well’s I do yours.”</p>

<p>“That’s kind of you,” drawled David. “<i>Mrs.</i>
Augustus Bamber sounds pretty well, though&mdash;eh,
Jennie?”</p>

<p>The girl moved her shoulders gently.</p>

<p>“Not on your life!” she said positively. “‘N’
I’ve told him so more’n fifty times already, I guess.”</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes to David’s with innocent
coquetry.</p>

<p>“I don’t b’lieve in gettin’ married t’ anybody ’nless
you’re awfully in love with ’em. That’s what I keep
tellin’ Gus, but he says&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Are you coming with me to get that ice cream?”
asked David, stifling a yawn.</p>

<p>“I dunno whether I’ve got the nerve,” murmured
the girl. “The ice cream’s in the same booth where
Gus is; it’s right acrost from where Sutton’s got his
concession. ’F he should see me&mdash;with you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose he’d do about it?” inquired
David. “Gus&mdash;er&mdash;went off and left you,
didn’t he?”</p>

<p>He paused to laugh sourly; then added, “And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
my girl wouldn’t come with me; so I guess it’s
up to us to do the best we can to have a good time,
Jennie. If you’ll come along with me, we’ll take in
the whole darned show.”</p>

<p>“If you think it would be all right, Mr. Whitcomb.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t it be all right, I’d like to
know?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, only&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Only what? Out with it, little girl.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’m kind of scared of you, Mr. Whitcomb,”
faltered the girl. “You&mdash;you’re so&mdash;tall&mdash;’n’&mdash;’n’
handsome, ’n’ you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>David laughed outright. The girl’s eyes and voice
conveyed so delicious a flattery that he could not
help the tenderness that crept into his words.</p>

<p>“Why, you dear little goose, you,” he said in her
ear, “I won’t hurt you, and nobody else shall, either,
when I’m around. Come, we’ll go and eat that ice
cream, right where Augustus Bamber, Esquire, can
see us; then we’ll take in the other attractions. Have
you seen anything yet?”</p>

<p>“Only the cake an’ jell’ an’ canned peaches an’
stuff, an’ those stupid ol’ quilts an’ things,” said the
girl, with spirit. “Those women are all ’s mad as
wet hens because the quilt with red stars got the blue
ribbon over the one with yellow moons on it, an’ they
pretty near come to a scrap over those two big fruitcakes.
One of ’em’s got white roses made out o’
tissue paper round the edge, an’ the other’s got a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
bride on top made out o’ sugar, with a real veil an’
bouquet. It’s awful cute.”</p>

<p>“A bride made out of sugar must be pretty sweet,”
said David, smacking his lips and smiling down into
the pretty, foolish face at his side. “But I know
somebody that’ll be a heap sweeter&mdash;when she’s a
bride.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mis-ter Whitcomb!” breathed the girl, the
pink brightening in her round cheeks. “But, of
course, you meant&mdash;her. She’s awful good-lookin’.”</p>

<p>“No; I didn’t mean&mdash;her,” said David, laughing
outright. “I meant you, Jennie.”</p>

<p>The girl looked down and bit her lips in pretty confusion.
Then she sighed.</p>

<p>“I shan’t never be a bride, I guess,” she said
mournfully.</p>

<p>“Why not? I’d like to know.”</p>

<p>“Because&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash; If we’re goin’ out o’ here, I
guess we’d better be movin’. Folks is lookin’ at us.”</p>

<p>“I have no objections,” David said coolly. “Let
’em look.”</p>

<p>“It was that insurance man that’s stayin’ t’ the
Eagle,” whispered the girl. “I don’t like him a bit.
He was right behind us; but he’s over there now,
lookin’ at those sofa-pillows.”</p>

<p>“You mean Todd? Oh, Todd’s all right. He’s a
good fellow.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like him snoopin’ ’round, just the same.
He’s got eyes like a gimblet; ’n’ he looks at you like
he was tryin’ t’ find out what you had fer breakfas’.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Gus says he’s a tight-wad, too. He don’t spen’
nothin’ at the bar, ’xcept you or somebody treats
him.”</p>

<p>“He’s welcome to all he gets out of me,” drawled
David. “Do you like your ice cream mixed or
straight, Jennie?”</p>

<p>“I guess maybe you’ll think I’m kind o’ funny,
but I like those little round pancakes, folded around
like a cornucopia with v’nilla ice cream inside.
They’re awful good.”</p>

<p>“All right; we’ll partake of cornucopias, to begin
with. Perhaps we’ll work around to the other kinds
after the races.”</p>

<p>“Oh, are there goin’ to be races?” asked Jennie,
nibbling prettily at the edges of the cone sparsely
filled with vanilla ice cream, which the scarlet-faced
man who presided over the gasoline stove and its
adjacent can of cold stuff, handed her with a wipe of
his sticky fingers on a long-suffering apron-front.</p>

<p>“Get onto Gus, will you?” she whispered, as she
bridled, laughed, blushed, and giggled by turns, under
the baleful light of Mr. Bamber’s pale-green eyes.
“I ’xpect he’ll kill me jus’ the minute he gets a
chance. Gus hates you; did you know it, Mr. Whitcomb?”</p>

<p>“Hates me? Why should he? I’m sure I’ve given
the fellow tips enough,” David said arrogantly.</p>

<p>All the light went out of the girl’s blue eyes.</p>

<p>“You’ve given me ‘tips,’ as you call them, too,”
she said soberly. “Do you want to know what I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
done with ’em? I jus’ hated to take money from
you; but I didn’t know what else t’ do; so I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, what did you do with the munificent sums
I’ve bestowed on you from time to time?” inquired
David good-humoredly. “I’d really like to know.”</p>

<p>The girl had finished her ice cream, leathery receptacle
and all. She began pulling on her white
cotton gloves.</p>

<p>“Let’s go outside, where Gus can’t see us, an’ I’ll
show you,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“We’ll go up to the grand stand,” David proposed.
“One of my horses is going to race,” he added magnificently,
“and you shall bet on him. Would you
like to? I’ll pay, of course, if you lose.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t betting kind o’ wicked?” asked the girl
innocently. “The Meth’dist minister said it was.
Me an’ Gus went t’ church an’ heard a sermon las’
Sunday night.”</p>

<p>“Nothing would be wicked for you,” decided
David, “except to throw yourself away on that
greasy little cad, Bamber. Promise me you won’t,
Jennie. You’re about ten times too pretty and good
for such a chap.”</p>

<p>“I told you I wasn’t goin’ t’ marry him b’fore,”
murmured the girl. “I&mdash;I couldn’t.”</p>

<p>She pulled off her white cotton glove and spread
her short-fingered, blunt little hand for his inspection.</p>

<p>“There!” she whispered. “I didn’t never ’xpect
you’d see it. But that’s what I’ve bought with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the money you’ve give me for makin’ your toast the
way you like it an’ your coffee an’ all. I’m goin’ t’
keep it always, t’ remember you by.”</p>

<p>David glanced carelessly at the pink little hand,
with its close-clipped, shallow nails and stubbed
fingertips.</p>

<p>“Do you mean&mdash;that?” he asked, touching the
trumpery little ring with its circle of blue stones,
which glittered speciously on the third finger.</p>

<p>“Yes,” breathed the girl. “You&mdash;you ain’t&mdash;mad,
are you? I&mdash;wanted somethin’ t’ keep always,
t’ put me in mind o’ you, when&mdash;I can’t do things f’r
you no more; I love t’ do things f’r you, an’ I don’t
s’pose I’ll always have the chance, after&mdash;after
she&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>David felt a sudden moisture in his eyes. There
was something touching, lovely, pathetic about this
innocent, unasking love. He felt a little proud of his
own understanding of it. Almost unavoidably, too,
there came to his remembrance Barbara’s proud refusal
to wear the costly ring he had urged upon her
acceptance.</p>

<p>“I am not angry, dear little girl,” he said gently,
“But I wish the keepsake was better, more worth
while.”</p>

<p>“One of the stones did come out,” confessed the
girl; “but I had it put back in, ’n’ I’m only goin’ t’
wear it f’r best.”</p>

<p>David’s hand was fumbling in his pocket.</p>

<p>“I bought a ring for&mdash;a certain young lady,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
said bitterly, “and she didn’t like it&mdash;or me&mdash;well
enough to wear it. I wonder what you’d think of a
ring like that?”</p>

<p>He thrust the white velvet case into her hands with
a carelessly magnificent gesture of disdain.</p>

<p>“Do you mean for me to&mdash;to look at it?” asked
the girl uncertainly.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course; look at it and tell me what you
think about it.”</p>

<p>The girl’s face was a study as the sunshine leaped
in a burst of dazzling colors from the imbedded gem.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she cried passionately. “<i>Oh&mdash;my!</i>”</p>

<p>“Do you like it?” asked David morosely. “Do
you think it’s pretty enough for a girl to wear?”</p>

<p>“Pretty enough? Oh&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She snapped the case shut.</p>

<p>“Take it, please. I&mdash;I’m sorry you showed it to
me.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because&mdash;I shan’t like this&mdash;this cheap thing
any more. It&mdash;isn’t fit to remember you by. It&mdash;isn’t
like you, the same’s this one is.”</p>

<p>His face flushed. He bent toward her eagerly.</p>

<p>“Give me the little blue ring, Jennie; I’d like to
keep it&mdash;just to remind me that there is a woman in
the world who loved to do things for me&mdash;&mdash; That’s
what you said, and I shan’t forget it in a hurry.”</p>

<p>She pulled the ring from her hand with a listless
gesture.</p>

<p>“You c’n have it, if you want it,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>She swallowed hard, her childish lips trembling
piteously.</p>

<p>“I shan’t care ’bout it no more.”</p>

<p>“Try the other one on and see if it fits,” said
David. “I’ve been carrying it about in my pocket
for a couple of months. She wouldn’t have it, and
I swore I wouldn’t offer it to her again. Take it,
and wear it&mdash;or sell it; I don’t care what you do
with it.”</p>

<p>The girl trembled, her round blue eyes on his face.</p>

<p>“Honest and truly, do you mean it?” she whispered.
“I’m almost afraid; it&mdash;it’s so&mdash;lovely!”</p>

<p>“Put it on,” ordered David, frowning.</p>

<p>He was thinking confusedly of Barbara, of her
coldness, her capriciousness, her bad temper, as he
chose to term her rather pitiful attempts to curb his
own lawlessness. It suddenly appeared to David that
he had been abused, made light of, almost insulted,
of late. What other construction could be put upon
Barbara’s behavior that very afternoon? He still
loved her, of course; but her treatment of him certainly
merited this tardy reprisal.</p>

<p>“You ain’t had a scrap with her, have you?”
Jennie asked timidly, “an’&mdash;broke off th’ engagement?”</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly,” he muttered, with a frown.</p>

<p>“Anyway, don’t&mdash;show her that ring o’ mine,
please. I’m ’fraid&mdash;she’d laugh.”</p>

<p>“She won’t see it, ever. Don’t worry about
that. And she won’t set eyes on that diamond again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
in a hurry. Take good care of it, little girl. It’s
good for a house and lot&mdash;that ring.”</p>

<p>“Is it a real di’mon’?”</p>

<p>“Of course, goosie; you didn’t suppose I’d buy
an imitation, did you? I guess not. It’s yours to
do what you like with. But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stared dubiously into her pretty, flushed face.
“Keep it to yourself that I gave it to you, will
you?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;won’t tell,” she faltered. “I’ll do jus’ as you
say, Mr. Whitcomb.”</p>

<p>“All right. Now you sit down here, and I’ll be
back in a few minutes. I’ve got to look around a bit,
and put some money on my horse. I’ll buy some
candy, too, while I’m gone.”</p>

<p>The girl sat, where he had left her, in a daze of
happiness. All about her the seats of the grand
stand were filling with people for the afternoon races;
but she did not see them, nor the arid stretch of the
race-course, around which were circling various experimental
trotters under the guidance of hunched
men in two-wheeled vehicles. The subdued light of
the shaded place brought out new and more vivid
flashes of color in the marvellous white stone on her
little pink hand&mdash;scarlet and green and blue. Jennie
twisted it slowly on her finger, her eyes riveted
upon its alien splendors.</p>

<p>“To think she didn’t like it!” she whispered to
herself.</p>

<p>“Good-afternoon, Miss Jennie,” murmured a carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
modulated voice at her side. She turned with
a start to gaze into Mr. Todd’s smiling face.</p>

<p>“Goodness!” exclaimed the girl petulantly.
“How you made me jump!”</p>

<p>“You were thinking about that new ring of yours,
I suppose,” said Mr. Todd, blinking pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Who told you I had a new ring, I’d like to
know?” the girl demanded coldly.</p>

<p>“I don’t have to be told,” Mr. Todd said facetiously.
“Say, but it’s handsome! I shouldn’t
wonder if it cost as much as two hundred and
fifty.”</p>

<p>“Not dollars?” exclaimed the girl, in an awestruck
voice.</p>

<p>“Sure! He must have thought a lot of you to
give you that&mdash;eh, Miss Jennie?”</p>

<p>The girl did not answer. She was putting on her
gloves with an air of offended dignity.</p>

<p>“I guess it ain’t any of your affairs,” she said,
her lips trembling, “if I’ve got a friend or two.”</p>

<p>“Don’t sit on me too hard,” begged Mr. Todd.
“I didn’t mean anything out of the way. I couldn’t
help noticing the sparkler on your hand. Most anybody
would. Get it to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did,” admitted the girl. “But you don’t
need t’ ask me who give it t’ me, for I shan’t tell;
so there!”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t going to ask,” asserted Mr. Todd truthfully.
“I&mdash;er&mdash;congratulate you, though. You’ll
let me do that, won’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl hunched the shoulder nearest him and
eyed him sulkily over its slender defence.</p>

<p>“I ain’t engaged; if that’s what you mean.”</p>

<p>“Not engaged&mdash;with that ring? Come, you’re
fooling!”</p>

<p>“It does look some like an engagement ring,” said
the girl, stealthily feeling her new treasure, “but
it&mdash;it’s only an offerin’ o’ friendship. He&mdash;he’s got
another girl. But I guess he don’t care s’ awful
much ’bout her. She’s good-lookin’; but she don’t
treat him right, an’ that makes him mad. I don’t
blame him, neither.”</p>

<p>“Do I know the party?” inquired Mr. Todd,
affecting a consuming curiosity.</p>

<p>“I ain’t a-goin’ t’ say, whether you do, er don’t,”
and the girl tossed her head. “I wisht you’d let me
alone.”</p>

<p>“W’y, I ain’t sayin’ anything out the way.
What’s your hurry to get rid of me, I’d like to
know?”</p>

<p>The girl moistened her red lips, with an anxious
glance at the stair.</p>

<p>“The’s a party bought that seat you’re in. I got
t’ save it fer him.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, too,” said Mr. Todd affably.
“I’ll get up an’ vamoose the minute you tell me he’s
coming.”</p>

<p>“He’s cornin’ now,” said the girl anxiously.
“He won’t like it, if he sees me talkin’ with
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Todd arose.</p>

<p>“He must be a great chap,” he said carelessly.
“Well, so long. Hope you’ll treat him better’n
you have me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Todd did not turn around to glimpse David
seating himself in the vacant place at the girl’s side.
He was whistling softly to himself as he wandered
idly about the enclosure below where the last bets
were being registered. The interest in the free-for-all
race appeared to be rather languid; but he looked
over the entries carefully; then fell into a desultory
conversation regarding the event with the gate-keeper.</p>

<p>“‘Tain’t a-goin’ to be much of a race; never is,”
opined that individual sagely. “The’s a lot o’ Rubes
that like to speed their horses ’round the course; but
it’s gen’ally a walkover fer one hoss. Bud Hawley’s
drivin’ the winner t’-day.”</p>

<p>“No, he ain’t,” interrupted a raucous voice from
the rear. “Bud Hawley’s a-goin’ t’ git left this
time.”</p>

<p>“That so?” queried Mr. Todd. “Who’s goin’ to
win?”</p>

<p>“I be,” said the owner of the voice. “Say, I’ve
seen you somewheres b’fore, ain’t I?”</p>

<p>“W’y, yes,” agreed Mr. Todd cordially. “But
your name’s gone from me just now. Let me
see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know now who you be,” put in the farmer.
“You’re the fellow ’at come int’ Hewett’s grocery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
a spell back one day when I was there. My name’s
Plumb&mdash;Hiram Plumb.”</p>

<p>“And your horse is going to win&mdash;eh, Mr.
Plumb?”</p>

<p>“Yas, sir. He’ll win, hands down. You’ll see!”</p>

<p>“Pretty tough on Whitcomb, if he does,” laughed
the gateman. “He’s put quite a wad on his own
horse.”</p>

<p>“He’s goin’ t’ part with his wad all right,” said
the farmer, wagging his head. “I ain’t a bettin’
man m’self; but I’m willin’ t’ put down fi’ dollars on
it.”</p>

<p>“I take you,” said Mr. Todd, with an agreeable
smile.</p>

<p>This small matter being adjusted, the genial insurance
man walked quietly away through the crowd,
humming a little tune to himself. Among the
vehicles drawn up inside the enclosure roped off for
teams, he caught sight of Jarvis, sitting alone, in
his usual red-wheeled sidebar. Mr. Todd made his
way among the crowd and presently paused at Jarvis’s
side.</p>

<p>“Our young friend is here to-day,” he observed, in
a low voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw him come in with the boy,” Jarvis
replied.</p>

<p>“Since then he appears to have got rid of the boy
and acquired a girl.”</p>

<p>“Where is the boy?” demanded Jarvis sharply.</p>

<p>Mr. Todd shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wasn’t looking after the boy,” he reminded his
patron.</p>

<p>“What’s Whitcomb up to?” asked Jarvis after
a silence.</p>

<p>His face was gray and set and his weary eyes wandered
impatiently over the dusty race-track.</p>

<p>“Horse-racing, for one thing,” replied the detective.
“He’s backing his own horse heavily; but
there’s more doing than that. Do you want to hear it
now?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Jarvis, “not here.”</p>

<p>Mr. Todd gathered his lips into a noiseless whistle.</p>

<p>“Our young friend,” he said slowly, “has appropriated
about all the rope he needs. All you’ve got
to do now is to let him alone.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">XXIII</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">It</span> was well on toward evening before Barbara found
herself watching with strained attention for the return
of David. Late in the afternoon she had been
visited with tardy contrition, which concerned itself
more particularly with the coldness of her refusal
to accompany him. For the moment she refused to
go deeper, and consoled herself with careful preparation
for supper. She would urge David to stay, she
told herself; he would be hungry after the long drive.
But at twilight the delicate biscuit and boiled ham,
that David loved, and the yellow squares of sponge
cake and the rich home-made preserves, which he had
approved, were all ready. The small round table
was set daintily for three, with shining silver and
napery and the long-cherished pink china.</p>

<p>The sun had set cold and still after a brilliant
day of high winds and flying clouds, and the big yellow
moon slowly shouldering itself from behind the
dark woods looked in at her festal preparations like
an inquisitive face. Barbara shivered a little in her
loneliness; then thinking still of the belated merry-makers,
she fetched firewood and kindled a blaze on
the hearth. The leaping light flickered over the
waiting table and cast warm, life-like reflections on
the dim old portraits on the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>They would surely come soon, she concluded, with
a glance at the tall clock in the corner. But this
faithful monitor of dead and gone generations of
Prestons presently became quite intolerable, so loudly
did it proclaim the lagging minutes. There seemed
to be vague stirrings, too, in the shadows, like whispers
sunk below the rim of sound. The painted eyes
of father and grandfather, preternaturally wise in
their perpetual mute observance, appeared to be
pitying her young ignorance. They drove her forth
at length into the chill of the autumn moonlight.
Down by the stone gateway she could see the empty
road winding away into obscurity on either hand,
like a gray ribbon unbound and flung carelessly
across the valley. A faint wind shook gusts of
fragrance from the cone-laden pines, and away off
among the orchards a little brown owl gurgled a
mocking defiance to the moon.</p>

<p>She would have said, perhaps, that she was worried
because David had not brought Jimmy home
early, as he had promised. The child would be cold,
hungry, tired; his little jacket was too thin; his
limbs unprotected; but beneath these quasi-maternal
misgivings lurked a keener anxiety, a more consuming
fear. This it was that held her there, listening,
listening&mdash;her whole being an insistent question,
which would not be denied. This clamorous doubt
had long been slowly growing in the mind which lies
directly beneath consciousness, stirring now and
again, like a child unborn, to lapse once more into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
quiescence. To-night, grown big and lusty, it thrust
itself upon her, a full-grown conviction.</p>

<p>She could have told no one, least of all herself, how
long she remained alone in the wan darkness, fighting
her losing battle; but her hair and clothing were wet
with frosty dew when at last she heard in the far
distance the unbroken beat of hoofs. It was a fast
horse, driven at furious speed; yet long before the
vehicle drew up with a muttered exclamation from its
occupant, at sight of her standing there in the moonlight,
she knew it was not David.</p>

<p>“I’ve got the boy here, and he’s all right,” Jarvis
said. “Get in and I’ll&mdash;explain.”</p>

<p>But he said nothing further in the brief interval
that elapsed before they reached the house. Barbara
had drawn the sleeping child into her arms, and
held him jealously close to her numbed breast. She
felt strangely still, unnaturally composed, as Jarvis
took the child from her and helped her to alight.</p>

<p>“I’m coming in,” he said. “I want to tell you
how it happened that I am bringing him home.”</p>

<p>“Is David&mdash;&mdash;?” she managed to articulate.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing has happened to Whitcomb&mdash;no accident,
I mean. Go in; you’re chilled through.”</p>

<p>She had taken off Jimmy’s coat and cap, and
the child, half awake, was nestled in her arms, when
Jarvis followed her into the lighted room, with its
table daintily set for three, and its cheer of burning
logs, which Barbara had stirred to a blaze.</p>

<p>She looked at him in piteous silence as he stood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
a tall, sombre figure at her fireside, looking down at
her with eyes full of a brooding tenderness of which
he was only half aware. He was anxiously searching
for words which would hurt least; for a balm of
comfort which, he knew, did not exist.</p>

<p>Jimmy, rubbing the sleep out of his brown eyes,
sat up suddenly in Barbara’s lap.</p>

<p>“David didn’t let me stay wiv him,” he quavered.
“He&mdash;he made me det out ’n’&mdash;’n’ he dave me some
money; ’n’ a big boy pushed me over and took it
away. I ran after David ’n’ called him loud; but he
didn’t hear me. ’Nen I got lost.”</p>

<p>“I found him,” said Jarvis, “asleep on some straw
in the comer of an empty stall.”</p>

<p>He smiled reassuringly at Barbara.</p>

<p>“The boy appears to need a general washing and
putting to rights, I should say; but he isn’t hungry.”</p>

<p>“Where,” asked Barbara, in a stifled voice, “is
David?”</p>

<p>“He’s gone wiv the pretty lady, I guess,” said
Jimmy sleepily. “She had roses in her hat. Why
don’t you have roses in your hat, Barbara? I like
roses.”</p>

<p>The little boy suddenly opened his eyes very wide;
his mouth followed suit.</p>

<p>“Look, Barb’ra,” he shrilled excitedly. “A man
dave me a sausage in the middle of a biscuit, ’n’ I
was awful hungry an’ I fordot&mdash;I mean I forgot&mdash;t’
bite wiv my side teef&mdash;’n’&mdash;’n’&mdash;’n’ one o’ my front
teef came right out. I lost it on the ground.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Barbara’s questioning eyes were on Jarvis’s face.
He turned abruptly as if unable to bear them.</p>

<p>“I called loud to David; but he was drinkin’
somethin’ brown out of a tumbler ’n’ he didn’t turn
around,” chattered Jimmy, “but the lady, she looked
at me, ’n’ she said&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He broke into a nervous laugh.</p>

<p>“It feels funny in my mouf,” he complained.
“Will my new toof come in right away? Will it,
Barbara?”</p>

<p>Jarvis drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>“If you’ll put the boy to bed,” he said, “I’ll&mdash;wait.”</p>

<p>He sat down by the fire, a grim look of patient
endurance on his face. In the room above he
could hear the light tread of Barbara’s feet, and
Jimmy’s high, childish treble upraised in excited
speech.</p>

<p>“He’s telling her all he knows,” muttered Jarvis, a
sick distaste for his own hateful task coming over
him.</p>

<p>It was long before Barbara returned. Jarvis had
decided that she wished him to go away without
speaking, when he heard her re-enter the room.</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“Sit down, won’t you? And let me&mdash;explain.”</p>

<p>Barbara lifted her head proudly.</p>

<p>“I think I&mdash;understand,” she said.</p>

<p>He gazed steadily at her, a frown of pain between
his brows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have known for a long time,” she went on,
“that it was all a dreadful mistake; that he&mdash;did not
love me.”</p>

<p>“And you?” leaped from his guarded lips.</p>

<p>She looked away, a slow crimson staining her white
cheeks.</p>

<p>“I could not bear it, if&mdash;&mdash;” she murmured, and
was silent.</p>

<p>“I hope you will believe me,” Jarvis said gravely,
“when I tell you that what took place was not intentional
on Whitcomb’s part. I know him, perhaps,
better than you think.”</p>

<p>A shadowy smile touched Barbara’s tense mouth.</p>

<p>“Nothing&mdash;was ever&mdash;intentional with David,”
she said.</p>

<p>After a long silence she looked up at him, her
eyes dry and bright.</p>

<p>“Will you tell me,” she asked, “just what happened?”</p>

<p>He drew a hardly controlled breath.</p>

<p>“I will tell you what I know,” he said reluctantly.
But he seemed unable to go on with his shameful story
in the light of her proud eyes.</p>

<p>“I already know,” she said quietly, “that he
abandoned Jimmy early in the afternoon, and that
later he was seen with&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The woman was a waitress at the Barford Eagle,”
Jarvis admitted reluctantly. “She has attended
Whitcomb at table during his stay there; and so,
of course&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know who the girl is,” Barbara told him, in a
low, hurried voice.</p>

<p>“He met the young woman on the fair grounds
quite by accident,” Jarvis went on quickly. “You
ought to believe that; and what followed was also,
I am convinced, wholly unpremeditated.”</p>

<p>“Well?” urged Barbara steadily.</p>

<p>Jarvis clenched his strong hands on his knees and
bent forward to stare frowningly into the fire.</p>

<p>“Whitcomb backed his own horse heavily and
won,” he said slowly. “Shortly afterward an altercation
arose between himself and&mdash;a young man,
who had previously been interested in the girl, Jennie
Sawyer. This person Bamber, became very
abusive, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Jarvis’s voice, which had been dry and caustic, as
if he were reviewing unsavory circumstantial evidence,
suddenly broke.</p>

<p>“Barbara!” he cried. “My poor girl, must you
hear it all?”</p>

<p>She was looking at him, her eyes burning beneath
her long curved lashes, the red of her under-lip
caught in her white teeth.</p>

<p>“Go on,” she said quietly. “Someone will have
to tell me. I&mdash;would rather hear it from&mdash;you.”</p>

<p>The sweat of agony glistened on Jarvis’s forehead.</p>

<p>“If I must,” he said hoarsely. “It was an accident,
Barbara. It would never have happened if
David had not been excited, wild with success; Bamber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
attacked him first, without due provocation, it
would seem, and Whitcomb retaliated&mdash;struck him, in
self-defence.”</p>

<p>Barbara heard his voice as if from a great distance.
She seemed to herself to be drifting away on a sea
of strange dreams. Then she roused suddenly to find
herself supported by Jarvis’s arm. He was holding
a cup of water to her lips. She sat up, her face
white and wan, her hands clutching the arms of her
chair.</p>

<p>“You were saying&mdash;&mdash;” she murmured.</p>

<p>“I ought to have told you in the beginning,” he
reproached himself, “Bamber was not killed by the
blow; but he fell and&mdash;struck his head against the
edge of a stall.”</p>

<p>“And David?” she breathed.</p>

<p>“The girl dragged him away from the scene of
the accident, and he&mdash;escaped. You know he had a
fast horse.”</p>

<p>She was looking at him dizzily through a mist of
pain.</p>

<p>“The girl went with him,” he said, reading aright
the question in her eyes. “There was talk of a pursuit,
of an arrest. But unless Bamber should&mdash;&mdash; I
think I may assure you that David will not be
molested.”</p>

<p>He did not tell her that he had used all the official
power at his command to shield the fugitives from
the fury of the crowd, and further that the injured
man had already received the best medical attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
procurable in the county. Barbara learned these
things long, long afterward, when the pain of that
hour had been assuaged.</p>

<p class="p2">It was more than three months afterward, and the
first snow was flying past the windows in big, feathery
flakes, when a letter came to Barbara from a town in
the Far West. It was from David, she saw, with a
painful throb of surprise, and postponed the reading
of it for a difficult hour, during which she reviewed
once more and for the last time all the futile anguish
and passion of a love that had bruised and hurt her
from its beginning. Then she opened the letter with
fingers that trembled not at all.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Dear Barbara [he wrote]: I suppose by this time you have set
me down as a poor skate of a fellow. It probably hasn’t occurred
to you that it is entirely your own fault that you will never see
me again. If you had gone with me to the fair that day, as I
wanted you to do, I should not have met Jennie, nor gotten into
a squabble with that unutterable cad, Bamber. I hear he got off
with nothing worse than a crack in his foolish skull to remind
him what it is like to try conclusions with a gentleman.</p>

<p>“I want to tell you, Barbara, that I’ve married Jennie, and
so far, neither of us is sorry. She is a dear little wife, sweet-tempered,
and entirely devoted to your humble servant. And I
don’t find myself so deucedly uncomfortable in her company as
you used to make me feel sometimes. Let me tell you, Barbara,
that you’ll never succeed in making any man happy till you get
off that high horse of yours and stop trying to run the universe.
But I don’t suppose you’ll care for what I say, any more than you
cared for me, and I don’t flatter myself that was a little bit.</p>

<p>“Just one thing more before I say good-bye for always. If
you want to know who your master is, I’ll tell you. <i>It is old
Jarvis.</i> I knew it all along. But I let you go on deceiving yourself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
since you seemed to prefer doing it. You can settle it with
him any way you see fit and I shall be satisfied.</p>

<p>“With best wishes for your future happiness, I am, my dear
Barbara,</p>

<p class="pi10">Yours faithfully.</p>
<p class="pr4">“<span class="smcap">David Whitcomb.</span>”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Barbara read this letter once; then she thrust it
deep down among the burning logs and watched it
blaze and shrivel into a black and scarlet shred, which
flitted stealthily up the chimney and out of sight, like
a wicked wraith.</p>

<p>She was still thinking soberly rather than sorrowfully
of David, when Jimmy dashed into the room,
his yellow hair standing up around his rosy face like
a halo as he pulled off his warm cap and threw his
books and mittens on the table.</p>

<p>“What d’ you think, Barb’ra,” he exulted. “I
had a reg’lar zamination in my ’rithm’tic to-day, ’n’
I passed it a hunderd and fifty. My teacher said I
did. I did a whole lot o’ zamples an’ wrote out all
the sevens an’ eights an’ nines, an’ didn’ mix up
seven times nine and eight times eight, or anyfing&mdash;I
mean any-th-ing.”</p>

<p>“You’re home early, aren’t you, precious?” asked
Barbara, glancing at the clock.</p>

<p>“Yes, ’course I am; I met Mr. Jarvis, Barb’ra.
He was drivin’ that horse wiv a short tail, ’n’&mdash;’n’
he asked me did I want to get in and drive him, ’n’&mdash;’n’
he let me, Barb’ra; ’n’ I don’t believe that horse
cares if his tail is short. He’s comin’ in the house
now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who&mdash;the horse?” asked Barbara, in pretended
alarm.</p>

<p>“‘Course not!” shouted Jimmy, in fine scorn.
“Mr. Jarvis is. He said he was bringin’ you a book
to read. I like Mr. Jarvis, don’t you, Barb’ra?
<i>Don’t</i> you?”</p>

<p>Jarvis himself, entering at the moment, heard the
little boy’s insistent question. He stood before the
fire, tall and grave, drawing off his gloves and looking
keenly at Barbara. She had grown only more
beautiful in his eyes, since the day when he had first
noticed her youthful loveliness, like a wind-blown
spray of blossoms against a dark sky. Now he perceived
that something untoward had happened to disturb
the quiet friendship which had been slowly
growing up between them in the peace of the past
months. Her candid eyes avoided his, and a fluttering
color came and went in her soft cheeks.</p>

<p>“What is it, Barbara?” he asked, when Jimmy
had gone exultantly forth to boast to Peg of
his initial victory in the difficult warfare of
education.</p>

<p>“I have just been reading a letter&mdash;from David,”
she said, without attempt at postponement or evasion.
“He is married.”</p>

<p>“Well?” said Jarvis gravely.</p>

<p>“I was glad to know that,” she went on. “I have
been afraid&mdash;for that poor girl.”</p>

<p>She was silent for a long minute, while the logs
purred comfortably together in the fireplace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she met his questioning eyes, her own filled
with a deep, mysterious light.</p>

<p>“He told me what I had sometimes&mdash;thought
might be true,” she hesitated; “that you&mdash;were the
unknown person, who&mdash;&mdash; that I really&mdash;belong to
you.”</p>

<p>Then the significance of her words flashed over
her, and her face glowed with lovely shamed color.</p>

<p>“I am quite rich now,” she went on hurriedly,
“and you must let me give you&mdash;pay you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I will, Barbara,” he said, with a quiet smile.
“If you will only give me&mdash;what you have acknowledged
really belongs to me. Will you, Barbara?”</p>

<p>She turned to him, all her woman’s soul in her
sweet eyes.</p>

<p>“To the highest bidder,” she murmured, and laid
her hand in his.</p>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
